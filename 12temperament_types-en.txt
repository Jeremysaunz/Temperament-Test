strengths:

* The ability to create '1 from 0', starting from nothing.

cautions:
* May appear impulsive as action often precedes thought.
* Explosive aggression and excessive desire for control under stress.

1. What is the energy structure of this temperament?
The Expressive-Driving type has an energy structure with Expressiveness as the primary trait and Driving as the secondary trait. This is a combination of two powerful outward-facing energies, creating a dynamism that constantly expresses itself to the world while simultaneously moving forward toward goals.
Energy flows in two main directions. First is the immediate expression of emotions and thoughts. They cannot keep ideas or feelings to themselves and reveal them immediately through words and actions. Second is setting goals and executing them rapidly. Once they think "I’ll do it," they move instantly and push through obstacles. When these two energies meet, they create a powerful drive that "speaks passionately and acts boldly."
However, this structure is relatively weak at gathering energy internally. It is difficult for them to reflect quietly alone, wait patiently, or restrain their emotions. Energy always seeks to erupt outward, and moving is more natural than stopping. Recharging occurs through interaction with people and new challenges; energy drops sharply if they are isolated or stagnant.

Key Keywords: Passion, Charisma, Speed, Influence, Straightforwardness, Expressiveness, Competitiveness, Sociability
For this temperament, "fast and strong" is the default setting. They speak as soon as a thought occurs and move as soon as a goal is set. Their speed of action is among the fastest of the 12 types, and they rush forward with an "act first, think later" attitude. Their reaction style is direct and honest. They don't beat around the bush and clearly express "I think this" or "This isn't right."
In terms of stability, there is high volatility. They exhibit explosive energy when passion is high, but their momentum drops sharply if they lose interest. Their moods fluctuate; they can go from excited to frustrated in an instant, or get angry and then cool off just as fast. They prefer change over routine and find repetitive tasks boring. While not the most stabilizing presence, they breathe life into organizations with their dynamism and drive.
3. Moments When Strengths Shine
The moment the Expressive-Driving type shines most is "when something must be created from 0." They naturally take the lead when starting from scratch, changing a stagnant atmosphere, or when quick decisions are needed. They step forward without hesitation saying "Let’s just try it" or "I’ll do it," and their energy becomes contagious to those around them.
A second area where their strengths emerge is in persuading and moving people. They captivate audiences with excellent expressiveness and charisma, evoking feelings of "this is worth a try" or "this sounds fun" through their passionate speech. They excel in presentations, sales, negotiations, and team motivation, eliciting the response "I want to do it because that person said so."
The conditions for flow are clear: there must be a sense of speed, challenge, visible results, and social recognition. If the environment is fast-paced, involves overcoming hurdles, shows immediate results, and allows them to be noticed, they run without rest. Conversely, slow, repetitive, solitary, or unnoticed work quickly becomes boring. Autonomy is also crucial. They perform far better in an environment that says "Try it your way" rather than being told exactly what to do.
4. Common Misunderstandings and Shadows
The most frequent misunderstanding they face is that they "act without thinking." In reality, their minds are moving very fast, but because they manifest conclusions and actions immediately without showing the thinking process, they appear impulsive to others. Prudent types may feel anxious, asking "Shouldn't you think about this more?", but the Expressive-Driving type has often already finished their judgment in their head.
A second misunderstanding is that they are "self-centered." Because they talk a lot, assert their opinions strongly, and enjoy being the center of attention, they are seen as only thinking of themselves. However, they are actually very interested in the team's performance and atmosphere—they just express it in their own way. They are trying to pull the team along by saying "Let's do this!" or "Let's go together!", not trying to succeed alone.
Shadows under stress are intense. First, aggression becomes excessive. Usually direct, under pressure they pierce others with sharp words like "Why can't you even do this?" or "Does that make sense?" Second, they make impulsive decisions. They might instantly choose extremes like "I’m quitting everything" or "Let’s scrap it all." Third, emotional explosions occur. Pent-up frustrations burst out all at once, shocking those around them and leading to later regret. Fourth, an excessive desire for control appears. They try to micromanage everything, saying "Just do as I say" or "I'll do it all."
5. Emotional Flow and Recovery Patterns
Their emotions are wave-like, rising and falling quickly. Tremendous passion or anger can surge in a moment but subside just as fast. The transition is so quick that one might wonder, "What was that anger about earlier?" Because they cannot hold emotions inside for long and express them immediately, emotions rarely rot and fester, though the intensity of the moment is high.
Emotions accumulate primarily when they "are not recognized or are blocked." Strong frustration and anger arise when their efforts are ignored, when they are controlled, or when their right to speak is taken away. Boredom is also a source of negative emotion. A repetitive routine without stimulation leads to a buildup of "meaninglessness," resulting in lethargy.
Energy recovery happens through interaction with people + new stimulation. Quiet rest alone is not enough; they are recharged when chatting excitedly with friends, going to new places, or starting a challenging task. Physical energy release, like exercise or singing loudly, is also effective. Conversely, long-term isolation or staying still without stimulation drains their energy. The best recovery for them is "doing fun things with fun people."
6. Behavioral Responses in Relationships
In close relationships, they are passionate and direct. They cannot hide their feelings and actively express "I like you" or "Let's do this together." They pour a lot of energy into relationships, try to entertain the other person, and love creating new experiences together. However, because their emotional expression is so intense, they can overwhelm partners who are quiet or cautious.
In conflict situations, they prefer a frontal approach. Unable to tolerate discomfort, they try to resolve it immediately by saying "Let's talk now." They find avoiding or delaying even more frustrating, so they may push the other person by saying "Why aren't you saying anything?" or "Tell me what you're thinking." During arguments, their voice may get louder and emotions may flare, but once resolved, they quickly forget and return to normal, saying "It's okay now."
The problem is that a dominant attitude can emerge. They may ignore the other person's opinion and force their own way, thinking "I know better" or "It's right to do it my way." Also, they tend to offer solutions before empathy, frustrating partners who "just want to be heard." In intimate relationships, they tend to say "You can just do this" before saying "I understand how you feel."
7. Roles within Teams and Organizations
They naturally take on roles as the vanguard, motivator, and change agent. They are the first to speak in meetings, provide momentum by saying "Let's just start," and breathe life into a stagnant team. Even if not the official leader, they are recognized as "practical influencers" due to their loud voice and strong presence. They lead the team by suggesting directions, especially during crises or when change is needed.
Regarding synergy with other types: with Driving types (Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), they move quickly due to a similar sense of speed, but they may clash as both want to take the lead. With Expressive types (Expressive-Stable, Expressive-Reflective), they create a fun atmosphere with similar social energy, but they end up being the ones pulling the execution. Conflict can arise with Reflective types (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable) due to the speed difference—"Let's hurry up" vs. "Let's think more." Stable types (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective) may find their speed and changes burdensome, but conversely, the Expressive-Driving type can reduce mistakes thanks to the Stable type's prudence.
The conflict point in organizations is excessive control. They may make team members feel alienated by ignoring others' opinions or proceeding without consultation, saying "I'll do it all" or "This is the way." Lack of persistence is also an issue. They start brilliantly but lose interest during the routine execution phase, wanting to jump to the next project.
8. Working Style and Execution Rhythm
The starting speed is immediate. If they think "This is good," they depart with the attitude "Let's just do it" even without a perfect plan. They move into execution even if only 50% prepared, preferring to learn and adjust as they go. Their basic stance is "Don't just think, just dive in." This allows for a fast start but often leads to trial and error due to lack of preparation.
Persistence is characterized by early-stage concentration. They pour immense energy in at the start, but momentum drops as the initial passion cools. They feel bored during intermediate stages requiring repetitive or detailed work and start looking elsewhere, thinking "This is getting tedious" or "I want to do something new." Thus, they often start multiple projects but fail to finish them.
The finishing pattern is either an explosive short-term sprint or reliance on others. As the deadline approaches, they finish with superhuman focus, or they pass the detailed final tasks to others, saying "Can you handle this part?" Since detailed checking is not their strength, they achieve the best results when collaborating with partners (Stable or Reflective types) who excel at it.
9. Growth Direction and Management Strategies
The first area they must consciously train is listening and deliberation. Since "speaking" and "immediate reaction" are instinctive, they must practice "pausing for 3 seconds," "listening until the end," and "thinking for a day." It is important to create the margin to say "I'll think about this" rather than reacting instantly to every situation.
Second is persistence and the ability to follow through. To develop finishing power, they should set a principle of "one thing at a time" and "until it's finished." Even if a new project catches their eye, they need the discipline to say "After I finish what I'm doing now." Using checklists or progress tracking systems is effective in preventing mid-way abandonment.
Third is emotional regulation and empathy. While intense expression is a strength, it can sometimes overwhelm or hurt others. They need the habit of asking themselves "How does my tone sound right now?" or "Does the other person want a solution or empathy?" Especially when angry, practicing waiting 10 minutes before speaking protects relationships.
In terms of environment, they should create one that guarantees diversity and autonomy. They should avoid structures with daily repetition and opt for project-based or varied task environments. They also perform best in organizations that say "Set the goal and find your own way" rather than those with micromanaging bosses.
As a routine, it's good to have a daily "energy check time." Because they tend to keep pushing even when burnout hits, they need at least 10 minutes a day to ask "How is my condition?" and "What is draining me?" Securing "quiet time alone" once a week is also helpful, as it’s easy to miss their inner voice when constantly seeking stimulation.
10. Summary in One Sentence
"A natural pioneer who fuels passion, creates paths with drive, and leads people with charisma."
You are a person who creates change by constantly releasing energy toward the world. You move those around you with words and actions, enjoy challenges, and make the seemingly impossible possible. Your passion gives people courage, and your drive brings speed to organizations. If you listen a little more, finish what you start, and learn to walk together, you will become a true leader who actually changes the world beyond just being a brilliant star.

=== TYPE_02 ===
name_en: Expressive-Reflective Type
one_line: A messenger of emotion and insight who feels deeply, expresses passionately, and moves hearts with authenticity.
keywords: Expressiveness, Sensitivity, Pursuit of Meaning, Sociability, Creativity, Empathy, Duality, Passion
strengths:

* Storytelling and branding abilities that package insights into moving messages.
* Creative problem-solving based on humanistic sensitivity.
cautions:
* Misunderstandings caused by the duality between their active and quiet sides.
* Self-doubt and relationship withdrawal that occur during emotional overload.

1. What is the energy structure of this temperament?
The Expressive-Reflective type has an energy structure with Expressiveness as the primary trait and Reflection as the secondary trait. This is a very unique combination where outward-facing and inward-facing energies operate simultaneously. They have a dual nature—being active and expressive with others, yet suddenly needing time alone.
Energy flows in two directions. First, they gain energy through social interaction and actively express their feelings and ideas. They are sociable and love sharing their thoughts. Second, they sink inward to explore meaning and understand themselves. They constantly ask questions like "Is this truly important?" or "Why do I feel this way?"
These two energies sometimes clash. While having fun at a party, they might suddenly feel empty, thinking "Why am I doing this?", or while reflecting quietly, they might feel a surge of desire to "meet people." Alternating between extroversion and introversion, their life task is finding balance between the social self and the inner self. Recharging happens through meaningful conversations or creative activities; superficial relationships or meaningless activities drain them.
2. Core Tendencies at a Glance
Key Keywords: Expressiveness, Sensitivity, Pursuit of Meaning, Sociability, Creativity, Empathy, Duality, Passion
This temperament is a unique combination of "bright and active, yet with depth." The speed of action is medium to fast; they move quickly if interested but slow down sharply if they feel there is no meaning. Their reaction style is emotional and expressive. They cannot hide what they feel, which shows in their face or voice, and they naturally say "I feel this way right now."
In terms of stability, the range of fluctuation is large. There is a clear difference between when they are very excited and very depressed. Also, because their extroverted and introverted modes alternate periodically, people around them find it hard to predict "Which version will I see today?" They repeat a pattern of active social exchange followed by sudden withdrawal, saying "I want to be alone." For them, stability comes from "meaningful connection." Even with many superficial relationships, they feel empty without depth, and they truly recharge in a few authentic relationships.
3. Moments When Strengths Shine
The moment the Expressive-Reflective type shines most is "when hearts must be moved." They exhibit natural talent in storytelling, presentations, content creation, and branding. They don't just deliver information; they package deep insights movingly, eliciting responses like "I see" or "I can feel the sincerity." Their combination of expressiveness and depth creates messages that are not superficial but resonate deeply.
A second area where strengths emerge is creative problem-solving. They step outside the box to suggest new perspectives like "What about this view?" and explain them so others can understand. They can simultaneously utilize humanistic sensitivity and communication skills in fields like art, marketing, planning, counseling, and education.
The conditions for flow are clear: there must be meaning, autonomy, creative freedom, and authentic exchange. If they know "why" they are doing something, can express it in their own way, and have real relationships, they exhibit endless energy. Conversely, they lose momentum in places with meaningless repetition, rigid manuals, or only superficial relationships. An environment where they can voice their thoughts is vital. They feel suffocated in an atmosphere of "just do as you're told."
4. Common Misunderstandings and Shadows
The most frequent misunderstanding they face is that they are "two-faced." Because their active, bright side and their quiet, reflective side look so different, people doubt them, asking "What is your real self?" or "Are you being fake?" However, both are real. They are sincere when chatting with people and sincere when thinking deeply alone. The two modes simply coexist.
A second misunderstanding is that they are "distracted" or "lack focus." This is because they have broad interests and show curiosity in many things, appearing unable to stick to one thing. In reality, they just can't focus on things that lack meaning; they immerse themselves deeply in things they find truly valuable. It just takes time to find that "meaning."
Shadows under stress manifest in several ways. First, emotional overload occurs. Usually deep feelers, under pressure they are overwhelmed by sadness, anxiety, and frustration. They get caught in extreme emotions, thinking "Why am I like this?" or "Everything is falling apart." Second, self-doubt intensifies. They fall into identity confusion, asking "What do I really want?" or "Am I a fake?", doubting all their choices. Third, they withdraw from relationships. Feeling "no one understands me," they cut off contact and shut themselves away. Fourth, perfectionism becomes excessive. They give up trying altogether, thinking "It's meaningless if it's only this much" or "I'd rather not do it if it's not perfect."
5. Emotional Flow and Recovery Patterns
Their emotions are "deep and complex waves." They don't just feel one emotion; several are mixed together. They feel happy yet somehow sad, excited yet empty, angry yet guilty. Because the layers of emotion are deep, they might be smiling on the surface while asking themselves "Am I really happy right now?"
Emotions accumulate from a "lack of authenticity." Empty fatigue builds up from formal conversations, meaningless work, or the feeling of wearing a mask. They also feel strong frustration when their self-expression is suppressed. Fearing "I'll be rejected if I show my true self," they hide and eventually feel their self is fragmenting.
Energy recovery happens through "meaningful connection + creative activity." Merely meeting people isn't enough; "real conversation" is needed. They recharge when sharing inner thoughts without pretension and feeling a sense of solidarity—"I feel that way too" or "You're not alone." They also feel catharsis when expressing complex inner emotions through writing, painting, or music. Conversely, they are drained by superficial relationships or lack of outlets for emotion. Their best recovery is "a deep conversation with one person who truly understands + creative time alone."
6. Behavioral Responses in Relationships
In close relationships, they are people who "want to connect deeply." Unsatisfied with superficial acquaintance, they seek deep exchange, saying "I'm curious about the real you" or "Let's have a real talk." They read the other person's emotions carefully, empathize, and willingly reveal their own vulnerabilities. They build intimacy by sharing wounds or worries—"I've been through this too."
In conflict situations, they prefer to "solve it through dialogue." When hurt, they don't avoid but try to communicate directly: "Let's talk about this." However, when emotions get intense, they may talk too much, bring up the past, and generalize with "You always..." But because they ultimately want to understand and be understood, they forgive quickly if the other person apologizes sincerely or opens up.
The problem is "excessive expectation." They want the other person to feel and express as deeply as they do, feeling dissatisfied: "Why won't you tell me your heart?" or "I feel like I'm the only one trying." They also have a "tendency to analyze." They interpret every word and action—"I think this means that"—sometimes creating misunderstandings by over-assigning meaning. They may try to read what isn't there: "When you said that earlier, you were actually disappointed in me, right?"
7. Roles within Teams and Organizations
They naturally take on roles as "mood makers + insight providers." They lighten heavy atmospheres with humor while pointing out the core: "But isn't this what's actually important?" They read and care for people's emotions while asking fundamental questions that make the team think more deeply. They suggest creative ideas and package them attractively to gain team consensus.
Regarding synergy with other types: with Driving types (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), friction may arise due to execution differences. Driving types want to "do it now," but the Expressive-Reflective type slows down to "think about the meaning first." With Expressive types (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Stable), they collaborate happily with similar social energy, but they demand more in terms of depth. With Reflective types (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable), they share a bond over inner exploration, but may hear "Can't you be a bit quieter?" because they are more active and expressive. Stable types (Stable-Expressive, Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective) may find their mood swings and whims burdensome, but the Stable type's consistency provides them with security.
The conflict point in organizations is "obsession with meaning." They constantly ask "Why is this important?" or "Is this right?", causing frustration by not just doing as told. "Lack of consistency" is also an issue. They may say one thing yesterday and another today, leading to evaluations like "They change their mind often" as their attitude shifts with the atmosphere.
8. Working Style and Execution Rhythm
Starting speed is "fast if meaning is visible, slow if not." If it's clear why the work is important and what it means to them, they jump in passionately. However, they procrastinate on "just do it because I said so" work. They may miss deadlines while waiting for perfect understanding or inspiration.
Persistence "follows the emotional curve." They immerse themselves even overnight when passion is high, but speed drops sharply if skepticism or boredom sets in. When they start thinking "What am I doing this for?", focus scatters and they look toward other, more meaningful-looking things. This leads to a pattern of starting multiple projects and oscillating based on emotional state.
Finishing patterns fluctuate between "perfectionism and compromise." Sometimes they finish quickly thinking "This is enough," but other times they can't finish, constantly revising with "Something is still missing." Especially if they attach a lot of meaning to what they’ve made, they feel pressure: "This represents me, it must be perfect," and thus miss deadlines. In the final stage, they focus more on the "overall message" or "emotion" than details, so they need help with meticulous reviews.
9. Growth Direction and Management Strategies
The first area they must train is "execution and completion." While good at thinking and feeling, they need to develop the ability to move into action and finish. Instead of waiting "until a perfect meaning is found," they should set a principle of "starting with 70% certainty." The mindset that "meaning can be found while doing it" is important.
Second is "emotional regulation and consistency." It is natural to ride the waves of emotion, but they must develop the ability to regulate so it doesn't overly affect actions and decisions. They need principles like "don't overturn yesterday's promise just because I feel bad today." Writing emotional journals or meditating to observe emotions without being swept away is helpful.
Third is "boundary setting and selective focus." With broad interests and a search for meaning in everything, energy gets scattered. They need the training of "not saying YES to everything" and "choosing the one most important thing right now." They need the courage to define "3 core values" and reject things unrelated to them.
Environment-wise, they should choose "environments where meaning, autonomy, and creativity are guaranteed." Project-based or creative work is more suitable than mechanical, repetitive tasks. A culture where they can have a voice and ask "why" is vital. Organizations with heavy micromanagement or those that don't welcome questions should be avoided.
As a routine, "recognizing duality and creating rhythm" is important. It helps to intentionally allocate modes: "Today is a social day, tomorrow is a day to be alone." Also, securing 30 minutes of "creative time" daily for writing, drawing, or music creates an outlet so emotions don't just pile up inside but are discharged healthily.
10. Summary in One Sentence
"A messenger of emotion and insight who feels deeply, expresses passionately, and moves hearts with authenticity."
You are a unique person with both surface and depth. You mingle happily with people while cherishing your inner world, and you speak actively while delivering deep messages. Your sensitivity helps you understand the world more delicately, and your expressiveness allows you to convey that understanding beautifully to others. If you increase execution, regulate emotions, and focus on one thing, you will become a true creator who makes meaningful change beyond just being an emotional person.

=== TYPE_03 ===
name_en: Expressive-Stable Type
one_line: A reliable pillar of the team who approaches warmly, supports calmly, and creates harmonious relationships.
keywords: Affinity, Gentleness, Comfort, Sociability, Consideration, Harmony, Steadiness, Friendliness
strengths:

* The ability to smoothly connect awkward relationships and create emotional stability within a team.
* The ability to form long-term, deep-trust relationships rather than one-off ones.
cautions:
* A tendency to restrain personal opinions to avoid conflict.
* Excessive sacrifice and passive-aggressive attitudes arising from an inability to say no.

1. What is the energy structure of this temperament?
The Expressive-Stable type has an energy structure with Expressiveness as the primary trait and Stability as the secondary trait. This is a harmonious combination of social energy and calm stability, creating a unique mix that delivers "comfortable warmth" to people.
Energy mainly flows outward, but it is not intense or aggressive like the Expressive-Driving type; it is soft and gentle. They enjoy being with people but do not seek to compete or dominate; instead, they create an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable. They often hear "I feel at ease with you" or "You are not burdensome."
The core of this temperament is "slow expression." They do express emotions and thoughts, but not hurriedly, and they deliver them slowly while considering the other person. They don't decide and push quickly like Driving types; they prefer listening to everyone and building consensus. While they don't analyze as deeply as Reflective types, their Stable prudence prevents impulsive decisions.
Energy recharging happens through comfortable interaction with people. However, they don't need as many people or as much strong stimulation as the Expressive-Driving type; spending time comfortably with a few close people is enough. Due to the Stable trait, they also occasionally need quiet time alone, and too much social activity can cause fatigue. Energy is drained rapidly in environments with conflict or tension.
2. Core Tendencies at a Glance
Key Keywords: Affinity, Gentleness, Comfort, Sociability, Consideration, Harmony, Steadiness, Friendliness
This temperament is summarized as a "soft and warm person." The speed of action is slow to medium; they don't rush and maintain their own pace. They are not impatient, holding the attitude that "it's okay to go slowly," and they respect the other person's speed. Their reaction style is gentle and receptive. Rather than strongly refuting or confronting, they acknowledge others with "That could be" or "Your thought is also right."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. Mood swings are not large, and their attitude doesn't change with their mood. Their appearance today is similar to yesterday and tomorrow, so people find them predictable and trustworthy. They often hear "That person is always the same" or "They never change."
However, because of the Expressive trait, they are not completely quiet or expressionless. They naturally express intimacy through bright smiles, friendly speech, and warm eyes. The meeting of Stable calmness and Expressive warmth creates a presence that is "comfortable yet not lonely."
3. Moments When Strengths Shine
The moment the Expressive-Stable type shines most is "when relationships between people must be created and maintained." They soften the team atmosphere, naturally connect awkward people, and create a harmonious environment where "everyone gets along." They exhibit natural talent in customer service, hospitality, education, counseling, HR, and community management.
A second area where strengths emerge is forming long-term relationships. They excel at building relationships over a long time rather than one-off interactions. They see customers as lifelong relationships rather than short-term sales, build trust with team members to work together for a long time, and create lasting ties where people say "I keep staying in touch with that person." They have a sincerity in expressing interest and taking care of others steadily, though not flashily.
The conditions for flow are clear: there must be a cooperative atmosphere, human values, a predictable environment, and positive feedback. They exhibit the best energy where there is collaboration over competition, people over numbers, stable routine over volatility, and recognition over criticism. Conversely, they wither and lose energy in cold, competitive, rapidly changing, and critical environments.
Autonomy is also important. They find micromanagement stifling but don't confront it directly, instead suffering stress quietly. They work much more responsibly in an environment that "trusts and leaves it to them."
4. Common Misunderstandings and Shadows
The most frequent misunderstanding they face is that they "have no convictions" or "no opinions." Because they accept others' opinions well and agree with "That sounds good too" or "You're right," they appear to have no thoughts of their own. In reality, they have opinions but restrain expression to avoid conflict and maintain harmony. Also, because they fully understand other perspectives, they truly feel "both are right."
A second misunderstanding is that they are "easy targets" or "easy to use." Because they are kind, have trouble saying no, and are considerate, some people exploit this by making unreasonable demands or shifting responsibility. People approach them thinking, "If I ask them, they won't refuse." They are indeed kind and want to help, but that is not "weakness." They simply lack the ability to clearly express their limits.
Shadows under stress manifest in several ways. First, passive-aggression. Unable to say "No" or "I'm angry" directly, they may say "Ah, yes..." and appear to accept on the surface but don't actually act or show subtle resistance. Second, emotional suppression. They repeat "It's okay" or "It's no big deal," swallowing discomfort until they hit a limit and suddenly explode or cut off the relationship. Third, excessive sacrifice. They keep yielding and enduring until burnout or depression hits. Fourth, relationship avoidance. When they feel "I can't take it anymore," they disappear without a word and cut off contact.
5. Emotional Flow and Recovery Patterns
Their emotions are like "calm ripples." There are no sharp ups and downs, and they stay relatively peaceful. Even if momentarily angry or sad, they digest it slowly inside rather than expressing it strongly. Because their emotional range is small, people think they are "always okay," but they are feeling emotions quietly internally.
Emotions accumulate when they "are not recognized or when relationships go wrong." They get hurt when their efforts are taken for granted or ignored, but they can't express it and pile it up. Also, if conflict or a cold atmosphere persists, they become anxious, blaming themselves: "Is everyone uncomfortable because of me?" They drain emotional energy by being unnecessarily self-conscious.
Energy recovery happens through "comfortable relationships + stable environments." They recharge slowly by chatting casually with close friends, spending quiet time in a favorite cafe, or maintaining a regular routine. Familiar and safe things help recovery more than dramatic stimulation or new experiences.
They also gain great strength from "recognition and gratitude." Hearing "Thank you," "I'm glad you're here," or "Thanks for always taking care of us" confirms their value and boosts energy. Conversely, if they go a long time without feedback and are taken for granted, they slowly become lethargic.
6. Behavioral Responses in Relationships
In close relationships, they are "sturdy supporters." It's not flashy or passionate expression, but they stay by one's side steadily, help when needed, and show through actions that "I am on your side." They listen well, empathize without judging, and become "the person you can lean on when things are hard."
In conflict situations, they tend to "avoid or mediate." They are very uncomfortable with direct confrontation and try to ease tension by saying "Let's not fight" or "Let's talk calmly." Even if it's not their fault, they may say "I'm sorry" first to restore the relationship and try to understand the other's position. However, they tend to push their own feelings to the back in this process.
The problem is "lack of clear expression of intent." By saying "Whatever you want" or "Anything is fine" without stating their own desires, they make the other person feel frustrated or like "I don't really know what they want." Also, having a "habit of enduring discomfort," they may say "It's okay" past their limit and then suddenly end the relationship, saying "I can't do this anymore."
Another problem is "excessive consideration." They may try to take care of things the other person finds burdensome or lose balance in the relationship by sacrificing themselves out of a sense of "I have to do this for them."
7. Roles within Teams and Organizations
They naturally take on roles as "team lubricant, relationship mediator, and supporter." They ease tension between team members, mediate by saying "Can't we each yield a little?", and ensure no one is left out. Even without an official leadership title, they become the "emotional center of the team," making members feel comfortable.
Regarding synergy with other types: with Driving types (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), they form a complementary relationship. When Driving types push forward quickly, the Expressive-Stable type adjusts the speed saying "Let's go slowly so everyone can follow" and cares for the emotions Driving types might have missed. With Expressive types (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective), social energy is similar, but the Expressive-Stable type is calmer and less flashy. To Reflective types (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), they encourage action saying "Don't think too deep, let's just try," while Reflective types point out risks they missed. With Stable types (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective), they collaborate comfortably due to shared calmness, but the Expressive-Stable type handles external communication more as they are more social.
The conflict point in organizations is "lack of decisiveness." They cause frustration by not stating a clear position, saying "I'm not sure" or "I'll think about it." Also, due to "conflict avoidance," they fail to give necessary feedback or pointers, leaving problems unresolved. They may be misunderstood as "being fine because they never complain."
8. Working Style and Execution Rhythm
The starting speed is "cautious and slow." They wait until they fully understand and are prepared, sometimes delaying starts with "Let's look into it more" or "When it's certain." They don't dive in like Expressive-Driving types; they try to minimize risk with Stable prudence. However, because of the Expressive trait, they don't do it completely alone and look for collaborators, asking "Is there anyone to do this with?" or "Can you help?"
Persistence is "steady but needs stimulation." Once they start, they have the responsibility to see it through, maintain routines well, and don't give up easily. However, if they work too much alone or without feedback, they get anxious and lose momentum, wondering "Am I doing this right?" Regular encouragement or words like "You're doing great" are the fuel that maintains their persistence.
The finishing pattern is "finishing sincerely." They meet requirements without being flashy and finish without mistakes. However, they are not perfectionists, knowing how to stop at a reasonable point, thinking "This is enough." They finish based on "Is it generally okay?" and "Are people satisfied?" rather than tiny details.
The problem is "speed." To other types, especially Driving types, they can feel too slow and frustrating. If pressured to "hurry up," they actually become more intimidated and slower.
9. Growth Direction and Management Strategies
The first area they must train is "clear expression of intent and healthy refusal." They need to practice saying "Yes/No" clearly, expressing "I think this," and refusing with "I'm sorry, but this is difficult." Setting specific goals like "Stating my opinion clearly once a day" or "Refusing once a week" is helpful.
Second is "ability to face conflict." Instead of enduring discomfort, they need the habit of expressing it early: "Actually, I..." or "This part is a bit uncomfortable." They must understand that avoiding conflict isn't peace but actually grows the problem. The mindset that "uncomfortable conversations are necessary" and "healthy conflict strengthens relationships" is important.
Third is "self-care and boundary setting." They must value themselves as much as they care for others and clearly set "time for me" and "my limits." They need principles like "Not saying YES to every request" and "I can only help others if I am recharged first."
In terms of environment, they should choose "cooperative and human cultures." Organizations that value teamwork and respect people are more suitable than cold, competitive ones. Stable structures are also important; highly volatile or uncertain environments cause them stress.
As a routine, "receiving regular feedback" is important. Instead of being anxious while working alone, it helps to periodically ask bosses or colleagues "Am I doing well?" Also, they should have a daily "emotion check" time. They need to ask themselves "What was uncomfortable today?" or "What was good?" and consciously check so they don't suppress emotions.
10. Summary in One Sentence
"A reliable pillar of the team who approaches warmly, supports calmly, and creates harmonious relationships."
You are a precious person who creates peace and connection between people. You make those around you feel at ease with kindness and stability, build long-term relationships with steady interest, and are the invisible pillar supporting the team. Your gentleness makes people feel safe, and your consideration makes organizations more human. If you value yourself a bit more, express yourself honestly, and set healthy boundaries, you will become a truly mature leader who loves yourself and healthily supports others beyond just being a 'nice person.'

=== TYPE_04 ===
name_en: Driving-Expressive Type
one_line: A natural strategist and vision executor who drives powerfully, leads with charisma, and turns the impossible into the possible.
keywords: Drive, Charisma, Competitiveness, Dominance, Decisiveness, Influence, Efficiency, Confidence
strengths:

* Breakthrough power that leads without fear in crisis situations to solve problems.
* Leadership that presents a vision and efficiently mobilizes organizational resources.
cautions:
* Misunderstandings of being dogmatic or viewing people as tools due to result-oriented thinking.
* Clashes with team members occurring when the desire for dominance and control is maximized.

1. What is the energy structure of this temperament?
The Driving-Expressive type has an energy structure with Driving as the primary trait and Expressiveness as the secondary trait. This is a combination of goal-orientation and charisma, creating a powerful leadership energy that "moves people while producing results."
The core direction of energy is clear. First, they focus on setting goals and achieving them. Once they decide "I will do this," they push through obstacles, prioritizing efficiency and performance. Second, they involve and mobilize people in that process. Rather than achieving results quietly alone, they lead the team with charisma and influence to go toward the goal together.
The difference from the Expressive-Driving type (Type 01) is clear. For Type 01, "people" come first and "results" follow, but for the Driving-Expressive type, "results" come first and "people" are the means to achieve them. If Type 01 says "Let's go together, let's have fun," the Driving-Expressive type says "Let's achieve the goal, and to do that, we must go together." The former enjoys the relationship itself, while the latter creates relationships for a purpose.
Energy recharging happens through "achievement and recognition." They feel fulfilled when they reach a goal, win, and feel the sense of accomplishment. They also surge with energy when people follow and recognize them, saying "As expected of you" or "You're amazing." Conversely, if they are stagnant, fail to produce results, or are ignored, they lose energy rapidly and become aggressive.
2. Core Tendencies at a Glance
Key Keywords: Drive, Charisma, Competitiveness, Dominance, Decisiveness, Influence, Efficiency, Confidence
This temperament is summarized as a "powerful and confident leader." The speed of action is very fast. Thoughts turn to decisions and decisions to actions immediately; "Let's do it fast" and "Let's do it now" are the default modes. The reaction style is direct and powerful. They clearly suggest directions and take the lead, saying "We have to go this way" or "I'll do it."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent when there is a goal, but become unstable when there is no goal or results aren't appearing. They radiate overflowing confidence and charisma when winning, but irritation and aggression appear when blocked or failing. It’s less a mood swing and more a "reaction to the situation." Their appearance when things go well versus when they don't is extremely different.
Thanks to the secondary Expressive trait, they are much more social and charismatic than Driving-Stable or Driving-Reflective types. They enjoy communicating with people, passionately explain their vision, and emit an allure of "Follow me." However, they tend to see relationships as a means to a goal rather than an end in themselves.
3. Moments When Strengths Shine
The moment the Driving-Expressive type shines most is "when a crisis must be broken through and results produced." They step forward in situations where the organization is stagnant, a big challenge is needed, or quick decisions are required, saying "I'll do it." They take risks without fear, lead the team powerfully, and instill the conviction that "Following me leads to success."
A second area where strengths emerge is mobilizing the organization and people. They set strategies, arrange resources, assign roles, and present a clear direction: "This is how we go." They exhibit natural talent in roles like CEO, entrepreneur, project manager, sales leader, or politician. They possess both the ability to draw a vision and the execution power to realize it.
The conditions for flow are clear: there must be challenging goals, autonomy and authority, competition and stakes, and visible results. They catch fire when they hear "This looks difficult," exhibit explosive energy when given the authority to "handle it yourself," focus more when there is a competitor ("I will win"), and keep pushing when results are visible.
Conversely, they lose momentum rapidly in environments that are routine, repetitive, lacking authority, slow, and without competition. They complain and seek an exit, thinking "What's the point" or "This is a waste of time."
4. Common Misunderstandings and Shadows
The most frequent misunderstanding they face is that they are "dictatorial" or "view people as tools." Because they push, direct, and control powerfully, they appear as "having no regard for people's feelings" or "only wanting their own way." In reality, they are interested in the team's success and growth, but their expression manifests as pressure like "You can do better" or "You should at least do this," leading to misunderstandings.
A second misunderstanding is that they have "no emotions" or are "cold." This is because they prioritize efficiency and results, judge with logic over emotion, and ask "Why is that a problem?" However, they do have emotions and affection for people. They just don't know how to express them softly and think "showing it through performance" is true care.
Shadows under stress are intense. First, the desire for dominance and control is maximized. They shut out others' opinions, saying "Do as I say" or "I'll do it all." Second, aggression explodes. They wound others with sharp criticism like "You can't even do this?" or "Incompetent." Third, they make impulsive decisions. They may instantly choose extremes like "Scrap it all" or "I'm quitting." Fourth, they become isolated. They try to solve everything alone, trusting no one and thinking "What do you guys know."
5. Emotional Flow and Recovery Patterns
Their emotions are "intense but quickly transitioning lightning." Strong anger or frustration surges in a moment but shifts quickly when the problem is solved or a new goal appears. They show such fast recovery that one might wonder "What was that anger about earlier?" Because they express emotions immediately rather than keeping them inside, emotions rarely fester.
Emotions accumulate from "helplessness and being ignored." Strong frustration and anger build up in situations they cannot control, when effort yields no results, or when their abilities and achievements are not recognized. They become aggressive with thoughts like "After all I've done" or "How dare they."
Energy recovery happens through "achievement and challenge." Quiet rest isn't enough; they are recharged when achieving something, jumping into a new challenge, or discharging energy through sweating in exercise. They feel alive when constantly moving and doing something, thinking "I'm stifled if I'm still."
"Recognition and respect" are also key recovery factors. Hearing "We couldn't have done it without you" or "As expected, you're amazing" restores self-esteem and boosts energy. Conversely, long periods without results or being ignored can lead to self-doubt and depression.
6. Behavioral Responses in Relationships
In close relationships, they are the ones "leading and directing." They suggest the direction—"Let's do this," "I'd like to go this way"—actively make plans, and solve problems for the partner. They show a responsible and caring side by saying "I'll handle it," but sometimes make one-sided decisions without asking the partner's intent.
In conflict situations, they prefer a "frontal showdown." They don't avoid or delay, saying "Let's talk now," and strongly assert their position with logic and facts. In arguments, the urge to win is strong, so they try to overwhelm the partner and sometimes speak harshly, hurting feelings. But after "winning," they quickly move on, thinking "Is it settled now?"
The problem is "dominance and control." They don't respect the partner's autonomy and force their own way, thinking "I know better" or "My way is right." Also, they often "ignore emotions." Even when the partner says "I just want you to listen," they immediately switch to solution mode, saying "So the solution is this," missing the empathy.
Another problem is the "need for recognition." They want the partner to praise their abilities or achievements and get hurt or angry at reactions like "I don't think it's that much." They want their contributions recognized: "I did this much for you," "You should be grateful."
7. Roles within Teams and Organizations
They naturally take on roles as "practical leaders, decision-makers, and crisis managers." Regardless of official rank, they suggest directions in meetings, make decisions saying "Let's do this," and lead the team. Especially in crises or when hard decisions are needed, they step forward to solve problems, saying "I'll take responsibility."
Regarding synergy with other types: with Driving types (Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), goal-orientation is similar, allowing for fast progress, but they clash over leadership. With Expressive types (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable), the Driving-Expressive type is more dominant and takes the lead in the relationship. Conflict arises with Reflective types (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive) due to differences in speed and style—"Let's decide fast" vs. "Let's think more." Stable types (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive) find the intensity and speed burdensome, but the Stable type's prudence controls the Driving-Expressive's impulsiveness.
The conflict point in organizations is "one-sided decisions." They make decisions alone and notify team members without sufficient discussion, proceeding with "Follow me, I'll take responsibility," which makes members feel alienated. Also, "excessive pressure" is an issue. They exhaust members by demanding high standards and fast speed: "You should at least do this," "Faster."
8. Working Style and Execution Rhythm
The starting speed is "immediate." If they think "This is good," they start with "Let's just start" even if only 50% prepared. Rather than analysis or planning, they are execution-first: "Let's learn as we collide." They do it themselves and demand it of the team: "Don't just think, just do it."
Persistence is "powerful if the goal is visible." If they feel results are coming and they are nearing the goal, they push without rest until the end. Even with obstacles, they find breakthroughs: "I have to find a way." However, if results don't appear or if meaningless repetition continues, they lose interest rapidly and look elsewhere, thinking "Is this a waste of time?"
The finishing pattern is "explosive focus or delegation." Near the deadline, they finish with superhuman energy ("I'll finish in two days"), or they pass the detailed parts to others: "You finish this part." They don't consider detailed review their strength and prefer division of labor: "I drew the big picture, you guys do the rest."
9. Growth Direction and Management Strategies
The first area they must train is "listening and cooperation." Before pushing their thoughts strongly, they must ask "What do others think?" and learn humility: "My way might not be the only answer." Specific rules like "Don't speak first in meetings, wait until others speak" or "Hear at least 3 opinions before deciding" are helpful.
Second is "empathy and emotional awareness." Don't just look at efficiency and results; consciously practice reading emotions: "How do people feel now?" "How did my words sound?" Changing the order to "Recognize before criticizing" and "Empathize before pointing out" will greatly improve relationships.
Third is "patience and respect for the process." Don't just shout "Hurry up"; understand that sometimes going slowly is the way to go further. They need the mindset of "Direction over speed" and "The process is also important." They must accept that growing people takes time.
Environment-wise, they should choose "environments where challenge and authority are guaranteed." Project-based or new business environments are more suitable than routine, stable tasks. They must absolutely avoid organizations where they are micromanaged. They produce the best results in "Set the goal and find your own way" style organizations.
As a routine, they need "time to stop." Because running constantly can lead to losing direction or missing important things, they must intentionally create time once a week to ask "Am I going the right way?" and "Is the team okay?" Also, a "gratitude expression" routine is important. Looking beyond results to tell members "It was possible because you helped" or "Thank you" builds a stronger team in the long run.
10. Summary in One Sentence
"A natural strategist and vision executor who drives powerfully, leads with charisma, and turns the impossible into the possible."
You are a person with a powerful force that moves the world. You go toward goals without hesitation, involve people to create achievements together, and exhibit excellent leadership that turns crises into opportunities. Your drive brings speed to organizations, and your charisma gives people courage. If you listen a little more, empathize, and learn to go together, you will become a truly great leader whom people sincerely want to follow.

=== TYPE_05 ===
name_en: Driving-Reflective Type
one_line: A quiet mastermind who analyzes deeply, designs strategies, and executes silently to turn the impossible into the possible.
keywords: Strategic Thinking, Independence, Efficiency, Analytical Ability, Execution Power, Prudence, Self-Direction, Goal Orientation
strengths:

* Strategic analytical power that pierces the essence of complex situations to design optimal solutions.
* Independent project execution power that plans and completes tasks without team reliance.
cautions:
* A cold and chilly image due to a focus on efficiency and logic.
* Analysis paralysis and lack of communication caused by perfectionism.

1. What is the energy structure of this temperament?
The Driving-Reflective type has an energy structure with Driving as the primary trait and Reflection as the secondary trait. This is a unique combination of "the thinking doer," creating energy that moves powerfully toward goals while analyzing carefully and setting strategies.
The core of energy flows in two directions. First, they focus on setting clear goals and achieving them efficiently. Once they decide "I will do this," they find breakthroughs and push through obstacles. Second, they constantly analyze and optimize that process: "Why is this the best way?" "How can this be more efficient?" They think deeply before acting and continue to evaluate and adjust while acting.
The difference from the Reflective-Driving type (Type 08) is important. For Type 08, "understanding" comes first and "execution" follows, but for the Driving-Reflective type, "the goal" comes first and "analysis" is the tool to achieve it. The former moves once they find meaning and gain conviction, but the latter set a goal and find the best way to reach it. If Type 08 asks "Why?" or "What is the meaning?", the Driving-Reflective type asks "How?" or "What is the best way?" more often.
Energy recharging happens through "independent achievement and strategic success." They feel fulfilled when they solve a complex problem alone and their strategy hits the mark to produce results. Self-conviction is more important than people's recognition. Conversely, they lose energy rapidly if stuck in inefficient processes, pushed to act without time for deep thought, or if they lose control.
2. Core Tendencies at a Glance
Key Keywords: Strategic Thinking, Independence, Efficiency, Analytical Ability, Execution Power, Prudence, Self-Direction, Goal Orientation
This temperament is summarized as a "quiet strategist and powerful executor." The speed of action is fast but not impulsive. They move immediately once thinking is done, but the process of that thought is prudent and systematic. The reaction style is restrained and logical. They don't react emotionally but judge objectively: "The facts are this, therefore we must do that."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. There are almost no mood swings, and their attitude doesn't change with their mood. They are calm whether there is a goal or not, and they don't get excited by success or easily crushed by failure. They often hear "That person is always composed" or "They don't show emotion well."
Because they lack the Expressive element, they are not social. They prefer thinking and working alone over mingling with people and consider unnecessary conversation or meetings a waste of time. They speak little, but every word has weight, and they deliver conclusions and core points concisely. They are evaluated as "Speaking little but doing the job for sure" or "Quiet but scary."
3. Moments When Strengths Shine
The moment the Driving-Reflective type shines most is "when a complex problem must be solved strategically." They analyze tangled situations to grasp the essence, design the optimal solution, and execute it systematically. They exhibit natural talent in fields like consulting, strategic planning, system design, R&D, and investment analysis. They are neither "just a thinker" nor "just a doer," but a perfect combination of both.
A second area where strengths emerge is independent project completion. Given a clear goal, they plan, execute, and complete it alone from start to finish. They find ways without team reliance, break through obstacles, and produce results. Once they say "I'll handle it," they finish it perfectly without needing reports or directions.
The conditions for flow are clear: there must be complex and challenging problems, sufficient autonomy, a logical environment, and clear goals. They exhibit explosive performance when faced with tasks needing strategy and analysis over simple repetition, given the trust to "handle it yourself," in organizations that judge with data and logic over emotion, and when there is a clear target to achieve.
Conversely, they feel stifled and lose energy in illogical and emotional environments, under micromanagement, with unnecessary meetings and reports, vague goals, or in situations requiring excessive collaboration.
4. Common Misunderstandings and Shadows
The most frequent misunderstanding they face is that they are "cold" or "heartless." This is because they show almost no emotion and only look at logic and efficiency. They are seen as ignoring others' emotions with words like "Why is that a problem?" or "Don't judge emotionally." In reality, they have emotions, they just believe it is right to separate them from work.
A second misunderstanding is that they "don't communicate" or "lack teamwork." This is because they speak little, prefer working alone, and try to minimize meetings. In reality, they just omit unnecessary talk and communicate accurately when needed. Their standard for "needed" is just much higher than most.
Shadows under stress manifest in several ways. First, excessive control. They refuse to accept any other way and insist on their own strategy: "I'll only do it my way." Second, cynicism and blame. They 위축 (intimidate/shrink) people with cold criticism: "I knew it wouldn't work" or "It's inefficient." Third, complete withdrawal. They shut themselves away, saying "I don't care anymore." Fourth, analysis paralysis. They waste time by only thinking and failing to decide because they "aren't sure yet."
5. Emotional Flow and Recovery Patterns
Their emotions are like "quietly flowing groundwater." They are rarely revealed on the surface, but are felt internally. However, they try to process them logically rather than expressing them. They look for causes and solutions rather than the emotion itself: "I'm angry, so how do I solve it?" or "I'm sad, why do I feel this way?"
Emotions accumulate from a "loss of control and inefficiency." Strong frustration builds when there are many variables they can't control, when illogical decisions are forced, or when they must follow clearly inefficient processes. Also, when their strategy or judgment is ignored, anger piles up inside, though they only say "Understood" on the outside.
Energy recovery happens through "independent achievement and time for organization." They recharge when solving a complex problem alone, designing a new strategy, or organizing thoughts while reading quietly. They recover energy in "time alone" rather than social interaction or stimulating activities.
Creating "systems and order" also helps recovery. They feel satisfaction when tidying up mess, improving inefficient things, and confirming "It's better now." Conversely, energy is rapidly drained if chaos and inefficiency continue and nothing is improved.
6. Behavioral Responses in Relationships
In close relationships, they are "reliable but distant." They keep promises, fulfill responsibilities, and solve problems, but are clumsy at expressing emotional intimacy. They express their heart through practical help—"I solved this" or "This is how you do it"—rather than words like "I love you" or "I miss you."
In conflict situations, they prefer to "solve with logic." They don't react emotionally but organize systematically: "The facts are this, the problem is that, the solution is this." When a partner vents emotion, they try to find a solution asking "So what do you want to do?", and fail to understand the demand to "just listen."
The problem is "ignoring emotions." By only looking at efficiency and logic, they miss the partner's emotions or the temperature of the relationship. They invalidate the other with "Why is that a problem?" or "It's illogical," and wonder "Why are you angry when I'm just stating facts?"
Another problem is "one-sided decisions." Once they judge they've analyzed enough, they decide and notify without consulting the partner. They trust their judgment ("This is best"), but the partner feels alienated: "Why didn't you ask me?"
7. Roles within Teams and Organizations
They naturally take on roles as "strategists, problem solvers, and independent executors." When a complex problem arises, they suggest solutions saying "I'll analyze it," and complete important projects alone: "I can do it myself." They lack superficial leadership but are recognized as key talents: "The work only gets done if that person is there."
Regarding synergy with other types: with Driving types (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable), goal-orientation is similar, but the Driving-Reflective is more prudent and analytical, so "Do it faster" and "Let's think more" may clash. Expressive types (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find the Driving-Reflective's silence and logic-focus stifling, but a division of labor where the Driving-Reflective handles strategy/execution and the Expressive type handles communication is possible. With Reflective types (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), deep conversation is possible, but the Driving-Reflective is more execution-focused and may urge them: "How long are you going to just think?" Stable types (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive) find the execution speed burdensome, but the Stable type's meticulousness prevents the Driving-Reflective's mistakes.
The conflict point in organizations is "lack of communication." Because they analyze, decide, and execute alone, team members don't know what's happening and feel alienated. Also, "critical attitude" is an issue. They make the team atmosphere cold with cold pointers like "This is inefficient" or "Not logical."

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "immediate after analysis." After thinking enough and establishing a strategy, they execute without hesitation. They don't start blindly like Expressive-Driving or Driving-Expressive types, nor postpone indefinitely like Reflective types. When they feel "I've judged enough," they move right away.
Persistence is "very strong when goals are clear." When the final goal and intermediate stages are clear, they silently follow that path and complete it to the end. Not swayed by emotional ups and downs or external stimulation, they maintain their own pace. However, when goals are ambiguous or forced to use inefficient methods, they lose momentum.
The finishing pattern is "systematic and perfect." Having a roadmap from start to finish, they check and complete without missing anything at the finishing stage. They take care of details themselves and don't pass over things saying "This is enough." They continue to revise and improve until meeting their own standards.
The problem is "perfectionism." They pressure themselves with too high standards, continuing to revise saying "Still lacking," sometimes missing deadlines.

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Driving-Reflective types need to consciously train is "emotional awareness and expression." Don't look only at efficiency and logic but consciously practice reading and considering emotions: "How might that person feel now?" "How did my words sound?" Just changing the order to "acknowledge emotions before stating facts" and "empathize before criticizing" improves relationships.
The second is "collaboration and communication." Don't try to do everything alone, share the process, listen to others' opinions, and open up to the possibility that "it could be better together." Concrete rules like "share progress weekly" or "hear at least 2 people's opinions before deciding" are helpful.
The third is "easing perfectionism." Don't waste time pursuing 100% when 80% completion is sufficient, and practice letting go saying "This is good enough." Need courage to start with a "sufficiently good plan" rather than waiting for a "perfect plan."
In terms of environmental design, choose "environments with complex problems and guaranteed autonomy." Avoid organizations with simple repetitive work or micromanaging, and seek environments where strategic thinking and independent execution are possible. Fields like startups, consulting, strategy departments, and R&D are suitable.
As routine points, "forced communication time" is necessary. While working alone is comfortable, deliberately create time to communicate with the team periodically. Also, recognize the "importance of rest." Since constantly thinking and working can easily lead to burnout, deliberately secure "time not thinking" and "days to completely rest."

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A quiet mastermind who analyzes deeply, designs strategies, and executes silently to turn the impossible into possible"
You are a rare talent who perfectly combines thought and action. You solve complex problems with clear strategies, execute them systematically, and silently create results. Your analytical ability finds the best path, and your execution power walks that path to the end. If you acknowledge emotions a little more, share the process, and let go of perfection, you will become not just a capable individual but a true strategic leader who creates great achievements together with the team.

=== TYPE_06 ===
name_en: Driving-Stable Type
one_line: A trusted leader and solid pillar of the organization who plans calmly, executes steadily, and creates results stably
keywords: Steadiness, reliability, responsibility, composure, execution power, efficiency, stability, systematicness
strengths:
- Powerful persistence to complete long-term projects to the end without getting tired
- Calm crisis management ability that doesn't lose composure even in panic situations
cautions:
- Speed difference with temperaments wanting quick pace due to prudent decision-making
- Tendency to resist or be stubborn about rapid changes due to risk concerns

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Driving-Stable type has Driving as the primary temperament and Stable as the secondary temperament. This creates a unique combination of "calm executor," producing energy that moves toward goals without rushing, creates results but moves stably.
The core of the energy flows in two directions. First, they set clear goals and focus on achieving them. Once deciding "I'll accomplish this," they don't stop and push through to the end, prioritizing creating results. Second, in that process, they don't rush hastily but maintain their own pace. "It's okay to go slowly, we'll get there anyway" - they proceed stably and steadily.
The difference from Driving-Expressive or Expressive-Driving is clear. They are flashy, fast, and dynamic, but Driving-Stable is quiet, silent, and persistent. Like the tortoise in "The Tortoise and the Hare," not fast but not stopping and eventually reaching the goal. Few words but solid work, not flashy but reliable, not immediate but sustainable.
Energy is recharged through "stable achievement and predictable environment." When proceeding as planned, achievements steadily accumulate, and work flows without major fluctuations, they feel fulfilled. Conversely, sudden changes, constant crises, and unpredictable situations continuing rapidly deplete energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Steadiness, reliability, responsibility, composure, execution power, efficiency, stability, systematicness
This temperament is summarized as "organization's pillar that silently creates results." Action speed is moderate, neither immediate nor slow. They move after judging enough, but once started, push steadily. Response style is calm and restrained. Not reacting hastily but maintaining composure "Let's calm down first and go step by step."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. Almost no emotional fluctuation, attitude doesn't change much with situations. Maintaining similar appearance in good or bad times, they often hear "That person is unchanging" or "Predictable." This consistency gives great trust to those around them.
Since there's no Expressive element, they're not flashy or sociable. They quietly do their work, don't make unnecessary remarks, and prove through results. They receive evaluations like "That person doesn't talk much but work is solid" or "Can trust and delegate." Since there's also no Reflective element, they're not philosophical or deeply exploring meaning, but practical and realistic.

3. Moments when strengths shine
Driving-Stable types shine brightest "when completing long-term projects to the end." Rather than producing explosive results in a short period, they show their true value in work that steadily builds over months or years. Without getting tired or losing interest midway, they "Let's go slowly, but go all the way" - walk silently and eventually reach the goal.
The second area where strengths appear is crisis management and organizational management. Even in panic situations, they maintain composure and center the team saying "Let's calm down first and solve it in order." Also, they have excellent ability to efficiently arrange and operate people and systems. "This person for this work, that person for that work" - they place people in the right positions and run the organization stably.
The conditions for flow are clear. Clear structure and routine, autonomy and responsibility, long-term projects, and predictable environment are necessary. When there's a system saying "It proceeds like this," trust saying "You handle it, but be responsible for results," work that steadily builds rather than one-off, and an environment with few sudden changes, they produce the best results.
Conversely, in constantly changing environments, impromptu work, micromanaging, and short-term performance pressure, they become frustrated and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Driving-Stable types is "slow" or "frustrating." For fast temperaments, especially Driving-Expressive or Expressive-Driving, both decision-making and execution seem slow. They often receive pressure to "Hurry up," but in reality, they're just being careful, and long-term they produce results stably without mistakes.
The second misunderstanding is "dislikes change" or "conservative." Due to Stable characteristics, they prefer gradual improvement over radical change, showing reactions like "It's working well now, why change?" But in reality, they're not rejecting change itself, but concerned about the risks of unverified radical change.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, passive aggression. Outwardly saying "Yes, understood" but actually doing nothing or only doing their own way. Second, stubbornness. "My way is right" - never compromising and subtly resisting. Third, complete withdrawal. "I don't care" - letting go of everything and being a bystander. Fourth, depression and cynicism. "Everything is like that anyway" - giving up on everything and becoming cynical.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Driving-Stable type's emotions are "calm and stable flatland type." No sudden ups and downs, maintaining relatively peaceful. Even with happy events, they don't get too excited, and even with difficult events, they don't easily collapse. Not strongly expressing emotions externally, they process them quietly internally.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "loss of control and unnecessary change." When unable to control the situation, when sudden and unnecessary changes continue, or when their methods are not respected, dissatisfaction and frustration accumulate inside. But outwardly saying "It's okay" or "It's nothing," not revealing, then suddenly exploding or cutting off relationships when reaching their limit.
Energy recovery occurs through "stable routine and achievement." Maintaining predictable daily life, consistent exercise, and regular sleep gradually recharges. Rather than dramatic stimulation or new experiences, familiar and safe things help with recovery.
Also, "accumulating small achievements" is important. Checking off "today's tasks completed" or "this week's goal achieved" and confirming "I'm going right" recharges energy. Conversely, when no results come out or chaos continues, they become lethargic.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Driving-Stable types are "reliable support." No flashy expressions but consistently staying by your side, giving practical help when needed, and showing responsible appearance saying "I'll take care of it." They express interest through actions rather than words, solving problems saying "I solved this" or "Don't worry."
In conflict situations, they have a tendency to "avoid or remain silent." Uncomfortable with direct confrontation, they try to minimize or cover up problems saying "It's okay" or "It's nothing." They postpone uncomfortable conversations, expecting natural resolution: "It'll be okay with time." But if problems continue, they accumulate inside and at some point "I can't take it anymore" - they explode.
The problem is "lack of emotional expression." Not revealing true feelings and repeating "It's okay," the other person feels frustrated saying "I don't know what you're thinking" or "Can't know your inside." Also, "ambiguous attitude" is a problem. Not stating a clear position saying "Well" or "Let me think about it," the relationship doesn't progress.
Another problem is "resistance to change." Even in relationships, they block new attempts saying "It's fine now, why change?" and try to repeat only safe and familiar patterns.

7. Role in teams and organizations
Driving-Stable types naturally take on roles as "organization's pillar, stabilizing force, working-level manager." Not flashy leaders but recognized as key personnel saying "Work runs because that person is there." They respond calmly in crisis situations, complete long-term projects to the end, and maintain team stability.
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Reflective), goal orientation is similar, but Driving-Stable is slower and more cautious, so "A little faster" and "A little more careful" clash. However, when Driving's speed and Driving-Stable's stability combine, it becomes the best team "fast yet mistake-free." Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find Driving-Stable's taciturnity and slow pace frustrating, but conversely, division where Driving-Stable handles execution and Expressive handles communication is effective. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), prudence is similar so they match well, but both are slow to act, so they may receive external pressure saying "When will you start?" With Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive), they collaborate comfortably with similar calmness and steadiness, but may lack innovation while being stable.
Collision points in organizations are "decision-making delay." Giving frustration by postponing decisions saying "Let me think more" or "Need to review risks." Also, "resistance to change" is problematic. They passively block even necessary changes saying "It's working well now, do we really need to change?"

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "careful and systematic." They start after understanding enough and making plans. Rather than "Let's just try" style, it's "Let's prepare properly and start" style. Since they identify risks in advance and prepare countermeasures before moving, they start slowly but make few mistakes.
Persistence is "very strong." Once started, they don't give up midway and push through to the end. Not swayed by emotional ups and downs or interest, if it's "work that needs to be done," they do it steadily. Like a marathon runner, they maintain their own pace and endure long hauls well.
The finishing pattern is "stable and solid." Even if not flashy, they meet requirements and finish without mistakes. Using checklists to check for missed parts, when meeting the standard "This is enough," they finish cleanly. Not perfectionists, so they also know how to finish at an appropriate point.
The problem is "speed." In situations requiring fast execution, it may feel frustrating, and when receiving pressure to "Hurry up," they rather become more withdrawn and slower.

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Driving-Stable types need to consciously train is "clear expression and quick decision." Instead of "Well" or "Let me think about it," clearly state position "I agree/disagree," and practice answering within 24 hours. Need courage to decide with "sufficient information" rather than waiting for "perfect information."
The second is "accepting change and flexibility." Shift from "It's fine now" to "It can get better" perspective, and experimental spirit to try from small changes is needed. Mindset like "try 1 new method this month" or "It's okay to fail, we're learning" is important.
The third is "emotional expression and communication." Don't cover up with "It's okay" or "It's nothing," but practice saying honestly "Actually, it's like this." Face uncomfortable conversations without postponing "Let's talk now," and courage to express "I feel like this" protects relationships.
In terms of environmental design, choose "environment with stable structure and autonomy." Rather than constantly changing or crisis-prone environments, predictable and systematic organizations are suitable. Also, culture that trusts "just give goals and handle methods yourself" rather than micromanaging is important.
As routine points, "trying small challenges" is necessary. Don't stay only in safe zone, but trying one "new attempt" once a week helps growth. Also, "regular feedback" is important. Since working alone silently can lose direction, need time once a month to check "Am I doing well?"

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A trusted leader and solid pillar of the organization who plans calmly, executes steadily, and creates results stably"
You are a marathon runner who is not hasty but doesn't stop. You present clear direction without being coercive, and consistently create results without being flashy. Energy flows stably toward goals, and composure not swayed by emotions gives people trust. If you decide a little faster, communicate honestly, and flexibly accept change, you will grow from being just a stable person to a more dynamic and influential being.

=== TYPE_07 ===
name_en: Reflective-Expressive Type
one_line: A thoughtful guide who thinks deeply, understands sincerely, and communicates meaningfully to convey wisdom and insight to people
keywords: Insight, meaning pursuit, authenticity, empathy, communication desire, inner depth, reflective expression, wisdom transmission
strengths:
- Excellent educational ability to convey complex and deep insights in ways the public can easily understand
- Ability to read others' hidden emotions and provide essential empathy
cautions:
- Analysis paralysis phenomenon that postpones action until conviction is established
- Relationship fatigue from excessively analyzing others' words and actions

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Reflective-Expressive type has Reflective as the primary temperament and Expressive as the secondary temperament. This is a combination of "inner depth and external expression," producing energy that thinks deeply but doesn't keep it alone and wants to share it with others.
The core direction of energy starts internally. First, they think quietly alone, explore meaning, and try to understand essence. They continuously ask questions like "Why?" "Is this really important?" "What's the real meaning?" and dig into their inner self. And they want to share the insights and realizations discovered this way with people. Not satisfied with just knowing alone, they want to express and interact saying "This is really interesting" or "Listen to this too."
The difference from Expressive-Reflective (Type 2) is important. Expressive-Reflective has interaction with people first and pursues depth in that process, but Reflective-Expressive has inner exploration first and expresses to share it. If Expressive-Reflective "excitedly chatters at a party then suddenly transitions to deep conversation," Reflective-Expressive "thinks deeply alone then goes out to meet people wanting to share this." The former has extroversion as base with introversion permeating, while the latter has introversion as base and manifests through extroversion.
Energy is recharged through "alone reflection time + meaningful conversation." There must be enough time to think alone, and relationships where those thoughts can be shared authentically. Superficial relationships or constant social activities rather deplete energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Insight, meaning pursuit, authenticity, empathy, communication desire, inner depth, reflective expression, wisdom transmission
This temperament is summarized as "thinking communicator and sharing philosopher." Action speed is slow to moderate, moving after understanding enough and grasping meaning. "Need to think more..." - they approach carefully, but once conviction is established, they don't hesitate to express and share it. Response style is thoughtful and authentic. Not reacting immediately but giving in-depth answers after thinking "Well..." for a moment.
In terms of stability, the inside is stable but external expression varies. Internal values and principles don't waver, but how to express them and how much to share varies with situation and person. They speak actively in front of trusted people but are quiet in front of others.
Since Reflective is the primary temperament, alone time is essential. However, unlike Stable or Driving types, with Expressive as secondary, they don't want complete isolation. They repeat "being alone, meeting people, being alone again, meeting again," oscillating between introversion and extroversion.

3. Moments when strengths shine
Reflective-Expressive types shine brightest "when complex thoughts must be conveyed in understandable ways." They have excellent ability to possess deep insights while unfolding them in language people can understand. They show their true value in fields like education, counseling, coaching, writing, lectures, and philosophical content creation. They receive evaluations like "Listening to that person makes you realize something" or "Explains complex things easily."
The second area where strengths appear is understanding and empathizing with people's inner selves. They read hidden emotions and intentions rather than superficial words, penetrating essence saying "What you're really struggling with is this." And they understand it without judgment, forming solidarity saying "You're not alone."
The conditions for flow are clear. Meaningful topics, deep interaction, sufficient reflection time, and authentic relationships are necessary. Not superficial or impromptu work but tasks that can explore "why," not formal conversation but environments where real stories can be shared, leisure that gives enough time to think without hasty rushing, safety to reveal true feelings without wearing masks - they demonstrate the best energy.
Conversely, in meaningless repetitive work, environments with only superficial relationships, constant rushing pressure, and atmosphere without authenticity, they rapidly lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Reflective-Expressive types is "slow" or "indecisive." Because they move after understanding enough and grasping meaning, fast temperaments find them frustrating. They receive pressure like "Decide quickly" or "Don't just think, try it," but in reality, they just don't want to do meaningless actions.
The second misunderstanding is "talks too much" or "thinks too complexly." They explain at length from context to essence when explaining one thing, often receiving questions like "Simply speaking?" But in reality, they're just explaining enough to convey accurately and avoid misunderstanding.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, analysis paralysis. "Still not convinced" or "Need to think more..." - endlessly just thinking without any action. Second, excessive reflection. "What did I do wrong?" or "Why is this happening?" - spinning in their head all day and blaming themselves. Third, isolation. "No one understands me" - cutting off connection with people and holing up alone. Fourth, meaning obsession. "What's the meaning of this?" - trying to find meaning in everything and missing practical actions.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Reflective-Expressive type's emotions are "deep and complex but selectively manifested wave type." Inside they deeply feel and analyze various emotions, but externally reveal them only selectively. They share true feelings with trusted people but quietly observe with others. "That person talks a lot in front of them but is quiet here" - appearance changes with the person.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "absence of meaning and superficiality." When unable to find meaning in life or work, when only formal and superficial relationships continue, or when repeating inauthentic conversations, emptiness and loneliness accumulate inside. "What's the use of all this" or "No one really understands me" - they feel isolation.
Energy recovery occurs through "reflection time + deep conversation + creative activity." They recharge when organizing thoughts quietly alone, talking sincerely with one or two trusted people, and expressing inner self through writing or art. Deep connection with a few is much more helpful for recovery than shallow interaction with many.
Also, "time in nature" is effective. They regain peace when thinking while walking, gazing at the sky in contemplation, and organizing inner self in nature's rhythm. Conversely, staying continuously in noisy and fast urban environments rapidly depletes energy.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Reflective-Expressive types are "deeply understanding and sincerely sharing" people. Not satisfied with superficial conversation, they pursue deep interaction saying "I'm curious about your real heart." They read emotions and intentions hidden behind the other's words, penetrating essence saying "What you really want to say is this, right?" They willingly reveal their own vulnerability and connect authentically saying "I have this worry too."
In conflict situations, they have a style of "understanding and solving through conversation." Not reacting immediately but first thinking "Why did they say that?" considering the other's position. Then they try to solve through deep conversation saying "Let's talk calmly." However, when emotions are complexly entangled, they request time saying "Give me some time to think alone."
The problem is "excessive analysis." They excessively interpret the other's every word, trying to read even what wasn't actually intended. They make burdensome analyses like "When you said that earlier, you actually meant this, right?"
Another problem is "difference in expectations." They want the other to think and express as deeply as themselves, feeling dissatisfied "Why don't you tell me your thoughts?" or "I feel like only I'm trying." They find it difficult to accept that not all relationships can be deep.

7. Role in teams and organizations
Reflective-Expressive types naturally take on roles as "insight provider, mentor, meaning giver." In meetings, they ask essential questions like "But why is this important?" or "Isn't the fundamental problem this?" making the team think more deeply. Also, they listen to team members' concerns and provide emotional support saying "I understand why you're struggling."
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), friction occurs from speed differences. "Let's hurry" and "Let's think about meaning first" clash. However, when Driving presents direction and Reflective-Expressive explains that meaning, the whole team can engage. With Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable), communication style is similar, but Reflective-Expressive pursues more depth. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable), deep conversations are possible, but everyone is slow to act, so execution power may be lacking. Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive) find Reflective-Expressive's endless "why?" burdensome, but Stable's steadiness realizes Reflective-Expressive's ideas.
Collision points in organizations are "lack of execution." They think and talk a lot but are slow to actually move to action, receiving misunderstanding as "All talk, no work." Also, "meaning obsession" is problematic. They continuously question "Why is this important?" not simply doing as told, causing frustration.

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "start when meaning is visible, hesitate when not." When clearly understanding why this work is important and what value it has, they start, but can't move with "Just do it because I said so" style. They sometimes postpone starting while waiting for perfect understanding.
Persistence is "strong when meaning is maintained." When convinced this work is important, they do it steadily, but when losing meaning, momentum drops sharply. Once skepticism starts like "What's the point of doing this?" concentration disperses and eyes go elsewhere.
The finishing pattern is "between perfectionism and meaning satisfaction." Sometimes they can't finish continuing to revise saying "This doesn't properly convey my thoughts," and sometimes they quickly finish saying "The core message is conveyed, that's enough." Especially in creation or writing, they sometimes miss deadlines worrying "Does this really contain my thoughts?"
The problem is "gap between thought and action." There are many excellent ideas in their head, but actually moving to execution is few. Often they don't end up doing it while postponing saying "Someday I should."

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Reflective-Expressive types need to consciously train is "execution power and completion ability." They're good at thinking and planning, but need to develop ability to actually move to action and complete to the end. Need principles of "start with 70% understanding" and "learn while doing" rather than waiting for "perfect understanding."
The second is "concise communication." Don't try to explain all context and background, but practice changing order to "state conclusion first, add details if needed." Should learn efficient communication like "summarize in 30-second version first" and "go deep only when the other wants to hear more."
The third is "stopping excessive reflection." Don't try to understand everything perfectly or analyze all emotions, but need ability to decide "This is enough" or "Stop this thought now." Maintaining the ratio of "30 minutes thinking, 1 hour action" is helpful.
In terms of environmental design, choose "environment with meaning and depth while requiring execution." If doing only purely philosophical or abstract work, it becomes detached from reality, and if doing only purely practical and repetitive work, meaning is lost. Fields combining depth and practicality like education, content creation, counseling, and coaching are suitable.
As routine points, "action-first time" is necessary. Set a certain time of day as "just do, don't think" mode, and practice stopping excessive reflection and focusing on execution. Also, "social energy management" is important. Appropriately adjust the ratio of time alone and time meeting people, maintaining balance to neither be too isolated nor too depleted.

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A thoughtful guide who thinks deeply, understands sincerely, and communicates meaningfully to convey wisdom and insight to people"
You are a person who sees essence flowing beneath the surface. You think deeply and express authentically, make the complex understandable, and sincerely empathize with people's inner selves. Your insights make people understand themselves and the world more deeply, and your authenticity creates safe connections. If you act a little faster, communicate more concisely, and let go of perfect understanding, you will become not just a thinking person but a wise influencer who actually creates meaningful change in the world.

name_en: Reflective-Driving Type
one_line: A strategic innovator who thinks deeply, penetrates essence, and boldly executes when convinced to create fundamental change
keywords: Strategic thinking, meaning pursuit, execution power, independence, insight, decisiveness, depth, efficiency
strengths:
- Long-term solution design ability that solves root causes rather than superficial symptoms
- Decisiveness and execution power that explosively pour out from the point understanding is complete
cautions:
- Execution speed that appears very slow until sufficient understanding is achieved
- Emotional distance given to others by prioritizing logic over emotions

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Reflective-Driving type has Reflective as the primary temperament and Driving as the secondary temperament. This creates a unique combination of "thinking executor," producing energy that thinks deeply but moves it to actual action.
The core of the energy starts internally. First, they think quietly alone, grasp essence, and try to understand meaning. They continuously ask questions like "Why does this happen?" "What's the real problem?" "What meaning does it have?" and analyze deeply. And when judging they understand enough, they boldly move to action based on that. They decide without hesitation, execute efficiently, and push toward the goal.
The difference from Driving-Reflective (Type 5) is important. Driving-Reflective has "goals" first and uses "analysis" as a tool to achieve them, but Reflective-Driving has "understanding" first and when that understanding turns into conviction, it "explodes" into "execution." The former is "How should I do this to achieve this?" while the latter is "Now I understand, then I should do it like this" - the order. If Driving-Reflective has clear goals from the start, Reflective-Driving's goals become clear at the end of deep thinking.
Energy is recharged through "independent reflection + meaningful achievement." They feel fulfilled when organizing thoughts quietly alone and achieving something based on that. Internal conviction "I understood properly and executed" is more important than superficial results or others' recognition. Conversely, when pushed hastily without enough time to think, repeating meaningless work, or having their understanding and judgment ignored, energy is rapidly depleted.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Strategic thinking, meaning pursuit, execution power, independence, insight, decisiveness, depth, efficiency
This temperament is summarized as "strategic executor who thinks then moves boldly when convinced." Action speed is dual. Slow and careful in the understanding stage, but once conviction is established, moves very fast and decisively. The moment they say "Now I understand," immediately converts to action. Response style is restrained and logical. Not responding emotionally but systematically judging "The fact is this, essence is this, therefore should do like this."
In terms of stability, the inside is very stable. Values and principles established at the end of deep thinking don't easily waver. Not swept away by external pressure or trends, they maintain their own conviction. They often hear "That person has firm thoughts" or "Doesn't waver easily."
Since there's no Expressive element, they're not sociable. They prefer thinking and working alone, avoid unnecessary conversation or meetings. Few words but each one has depth, speaking precisely only at necessary moments. They receive evaluations like "Quiet but scary" or "Few words but hits the core."

3. Moments when strengths shine
Reflective-Driving types shine brightest "when solving complex problems from the root." They grasp essential causes rather than superficial symptoms, design long-term solutions, and actually move them to execution. They show their true value in strategic consulting, system innovation, organizational change, and R&D. They receive evaluations like "That person sees differently" or "Penetrates problem essence."
The second area where strengths appear is completing independent projects from start to finish alone. They analyze problems alone, establish strategies, create execution plans, and actually complete them. Taking responsibility from A to Z without team dependence, once taking on something saying "I'll handle it," they prove through results.
The conditions for flow are clear. Complex and meaningful problems, sufficient reflection time, execution authority, and independent environment are necessary. Not simple repetition but challenges requiring deep thinking, leisure giving enough time to understand without hasty rushing, authority to take responsibility through execution after analysis, and autonomy to work independently rather than collaborate - they produce explosive results.
Conversely, in meaningless simple work, constant rushing, requiring only analysis without execution authority, and excessive collaboration demands, they become frustrated and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Reflective-Driving types is "slow then suddenly fast" or "unpredictable." Because they just think for a while then suddenly decide and move quickly at some point, those around are confused "Why suddenly?" or "Only now?" But in reality, they're just moving after sufficient organization in their head.
The second misunderstanding is "dictatorial" or "doesn't communicate." Because it looks like they think alone and decide alone, and push their judgment strongly. But in reality, they have conviction because they analyzed enough, and just omit unnecessary words while doing necessary communication.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, analysis paralysis. "Still not certain" or "Need to think more..." - endlessly just thinking and postponing execution indefinitely. Second, excessive control. "Only my way" - not accepting any other methods and insisting only on their own strategy. Third, cynicism and isolation. "I knew it wouldn't work" - coldly criticizing and distancing from people. Fourth, emotional explosion. Emotions suppressed normally burst all at once, showing extreme reactions like "I'll quit everything."

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Reflective-Driving type's emotions are "underground lava type that flows quietly in the depths then occasionally explodes." Barely appears on surface but feels intensely inside. However, not expressing it but trying to process logically. "I'm angry, why is that, how to solve it" - finding causes and solutions rather than emotions. But when exceeding limits, what was held in bursts all at once.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "meaninglessness and disregard." When repeating meaningless work, when their deep insights are ignored, or when pushed without enough time to think, frustration and anger accumulate inside. "I thought this deeply" or "Why don't they understand" - they feel isolation and emptiness.
Energy recovery occurs through "independent reflection + meaningful execution." They recharge when organizing thoughts quietly alone and creating something or solving problems based on that. Interaction with people is not essential, and rather alone time is more important.
Also, "recovering sense of control" is important. When regaining the feeling that they can understand and control the situation, energy returns. Conversely, unpredictable and uncontrollable chaos continuing rapidly depletes them.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Reflective-Driving types are "deeply understanding and definitely responsible" people. They don't look at others superficially but try to understand essence, accurately grasping "You're this kind of person." They keep promises and solve problems when they arise, showing responsible appearance saying "I'll handle it." However, being awkward with emotional expression, distance may be felt.
In conflict situations, they have duality of "solving with logic but also avoiding." When judged as an essential problem, they confront directly saying "Let's talk about this properly," but when considered a trivial emotional issue, they avoid saying "Time will solve it." During arguments, they arm themselves with logic rather than emotion, sometimes sharply pointing out the other's contradictions and causing hurt.
The problem is "ignoring emotions." Focusing only on efficiency and logic, they invalidate the other's emotions as "illogical." They frustrate the other with words like "Why is that a problem?" or "Don't judge emotionally."
Another problem is "unilateral decisions." When judging they analyzed enough, they decide and notify without consulting the other. "Because this is best" - they trust their own judgment, but the other feels excluded: "Why didn't you ask me?"

7. Role in teams and organizations
Reflective-Driving types naturally take on roles as "strategist, innovator, problem solver." When the organization is stuck, they point out essence saying "The root cause is this," suggest solutions saying "Do it like this," and actually move them to execution. Without superficial leadership, they exert influence saying "We trust that person's analysis and judgment."
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), execution power is similar, but Reflective-Driving thinks slower and deeper, so friction occurs from speed differences. However, when Driving pushes forward quickly and Reflective-Driving points out risks saying "Wait, need to think about this," mistakes can be prevented. Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find Reflective-Driving's taciturnity and independence frustrating, but conversely, division where Reflective-Driving handles strategy and execution while Expressive handles communication and motivation is effective. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), deep conversations are possible, but Reflective-Driving is more execution-centered so may rush asking "How long will you just think?" Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive) find Reflective-Driving's sudden decisions and fast execution burdensome, but Stable's steadiness realizes Reflective-Driving's strategies stably.
Collision points in organizations are "lack of communication." Since analyzing, deciding, and executing alone, team members don't know what's happening and feel excluded. Also, "dictatorial decisions" are problematic. "According to my analysis, doing it like this works" - setting direction without consultation, team members resist.

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "explosion after analysis." After thinking enough and grasping essence, they execute without delay. Unlike other Reflective types who don't postpone indefinitely, when feeling "I understand enough now," they move immediately. However, since the standard of "enough" is high, others find it frustrating: "Still thinking?"
Persistence is "very strong when there's conviction." When convinced this direction is right, they push through even with obstacles and complete to the end. Not swayed by external pressure or temptation, they go their own way. However, when doubt starts midway like "This doesn't seem right," they stop and think again.
The finishing pattern is "systematic and perfect." Having a roadmap from start to finish in their head, they check and complete at the finishing stage too. Not missing details, they continue improving until meeting their own standards. However, standards being too high, sometimes it's difficult to let go saying "This is enough."

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Reflective-Driving types need to consciously train is "emotional awareness and expression." Don't look only at efficiency and logic but consciously practice reading and considering emotions: "How might that person feel now?" "How did my words sound?" Just changing the order to "acknowledge emotions before stating facts" improves relationships.
The second is "collaboration and communication." Don't try to do everything alone, share the process, listen to others' opinions, and open up to the possibility that "it could be better together." Concrete rules like "share progress weekly" or "hear at least 2 people's opinions before deciding" are helpful.
The third is "letting go of perfect understanding." Don't wait until understanding everything 100%, but need experimental spirit saying "80% understanding is enough too" or "Let's learn while doing." Should practice "start and adjust" method.
In terms of environmental design, choose "environments with complex problems and execution authority." Avoid simple repetitive work or organizations where only analyzing without executing, and seek environments where you can plan strategies and execute directly. Fields like entrepreneurship, consulting, strategy departments, and innovation projects are suitable.
As routine points, "forced communication time" is necessary. While working alone is comfortable, deliberately create time to communicate with the team periodically. Also, "action deadlines" are important. Set deadlines for yourself like "decide and execute by this date" to prevent infinite analysis.

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A strategic innovator who thinks deeply, penetrates essence, and boldly executes when convinced to create fundamental change"
You are a rare talent who simultaneously possesses depth of thought and boldness of execution. You see essence not surface, plan long-term not short-term, and actually make what you analyzed into reality. Your insights find problem roots, and your decisiveness solves them. If you acknowledge emotions a little more, share the process, and let go of perfect understanding, you will become not just a capable individual but a true leader of change who creates fundamental change in organizations and the world.

=== TYPE_09 ===
name_en: Reflective-Stable Type
one_line: A quiet sage and messenger of peace who observes silently, thinks deeply, and accumulates wisdom calmly
keywords: Quietness, depth, prudence, insight, serenity, independence, inner exploration, stability
strengths:
- Unwavering composure that explores essence without being shaken by worldly chaos
- Deep analytical ability to thoroughly grasp risks from a long-term perspective
cautions:
- Excessive prudence that waits for perfect certainty and misses opportunities
- Tendency to completely cut off external communication and isolate when under stress

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Reflective-Stable type has Reflective as the primary temperament and Stable as the secondary temperament. This creates a combination of "quiet observer and calm sage," producing energy that thinks deeply without rushing, observes quietly while moving stably.
The core of the energy flows inward. First, they think quietly alone, observe, and try to understand. They continuously ask questions like "Why is this so?" "What is the essence?" "What does it mean?" and explore deeply. And they don't rush this process. "You have to look slowly to see properly" - they observe with sufficient time and don't jump to hasty conclusions.
The essence of this temperament is "slow depth." They don't actively interact with the outside world like Expressive types, nor rush toward goals like Driving types. Quietly, slowly, deeply, stably, they walk at their own pace. Without being swept away by worldly chaos, they maintain their center, "I go at my own pace," maintaining unshakeable serenity.
Energy is recharged through "solitude and tranquility." They need quiet time alone, undisturbed space, and an unhurried tempo. They recharge when reading books, taking walks, being lost in thought, and looking deeply inward. Conversely, constant stimulation, fast pace, noisy environments, and excessive social activity rapidly deplete energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Quietness, depth, prudence, insight, serenity, independence, inner exploration, stability
This temperament is summarized as "a person like a quiet lake in a noisy world." Action speed is very slow. They wait until they understand enough, think enough, and are certain enough, maintaining their own pace with "No need to rush, let's go slowly." Response style is restrained and thoughtful. They don't react immediately but answer carefully after thinking "Well..." for a moment.
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. There is almost no emotional fluctuation, their attitude doesn't change with circumstances, and they don't waver under external pressure or trends. They often hear "That person is always calm," "Unchanging," "Has their own world." This consistency and quietness conveys tranquility to those around them.
Since they have neither Expressive nor Driving elements, they are neither sociable nor aggressive. They observe quietly, think alone, and move slowly. They speak very little, but each word has depth, and while not flashy, their very presence provides stability.

3. Moments when strengths shine
The Reflective-Stable type shines brightest "when deep analysis and insight are needed." Rather than superficial phenomena, they grasp root causes, penetrate the essence of complex problems, and point out "This is the real problem." They show their true value when doing in-depth work in fields like research, analysis, planning, philosophy, and counseling.
The second area where strengths appear is steadily completing long-term projects. They excel at work that builds slowly over months or years rather than rushing for short-term results. Like "It's okay to go slowly, we'll get there anyway," they maintain their pace and go all the way.
The conditions for flow are clear. Sufficient time, quiet space, meaningful topics, and a stable environment are necessary. When given the leisure of not rushing but saying "At your pace," an independent space to concentrate without distractions, tasks that allow deep exploration rather than simple repetition, and a structure that is predictable with few sudden changes, they produce the best results.
Conversely, in places with constant rushing, distracting environments, meaningless repetition, and rapid change, they become frustrated and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Reflective-Stable types is "too slow" and "passive." Decisions are slow, actions are slow, and reactions are slow, so faster temperaments find them frustrating. They often receive pressure like "Hurry up" or "How long are you going to think?" but in reality, they just want to understand properly and avoid hasty mistakes.
The second misunderstanding is "indifferent" or "emotionless." This is because they are quiet, have little facial expression change, and rarely express emotions. But in reality, they are feeling deeply inside, just restraining from showing it externally.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, complete withdrawal. "I don't care" - they retreat from all relationships and activities and isolate. Second, depression and lethargy. "Nothing matters" - they can't get out of bed and spend the day. Third, excessive reflection. "What did I do wrong?" - they blame themselves all day long without taking any action. Fourth, emotional numbness. "I don't feel anything" - they feel completely disconnected from the world.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
The Reflective-Stable type's emotions are "deep and quiet groundwater type." They barely appear on the surface but flow quietly in the depths. There are no intense ups and downs, and they maintain relatively peaceful, but this doesn't mean there are no emotions. They just don't express them externally and digest them slowly internally.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "rushing and invasion." When constantly rushed, having their alone time invaded, or being pushed without time to understand, anxiety and fatigue accumulate inside. "Can't we go a little slower?" "Leave me alone" - they desperately want but can't say and endure until reaching their limit.
Energy recovery occurs through "complete solitude and nature." They recharge when reading books alone in a quiet space with no one around, walking in nature, or being blank without any thoughts. Interaction with people is not essential, and they actually need to be alone to recover.
Also, "routine and order" help with recovery. A predictable daily life, set schedule, and familiar spaces provide stability and conserve energy. Conversely, constant change and chaos rapidly deplete energy.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Reflective-Stable types are "quietly by your side." There are no flashy expressions or passionate displays of affection, but they consistently stay together, help when needed, and support with their presence saying "I'm here." They speak little but try to understand deeply, accept without judging, and "I'm on your side."
In conflict situations, they have a strong tendency to "avoid or remain silent." They are very uncomfortable with direct confrontation, and try to cover up problems saying "It's okay" or "It's nothing." They postpone uncomfortable conversations as much as possible, expecting natural resolution: "It'll be okay with time." But if problems continue, they accumulate inside and at some point "I can't take it anymore" - they cut off the relationship.
The problem is "lack of emotional expression." They rarely reveal their true feelings and repeat "I'm okay," so the other person feels frustrated saying "I don't know what you're thinking" or "You're like a wall." Also, "passivity" is a problem. They don't express their opinions saying "Anything is fine," so the relationship doesn't progress.
Another problem is "going no-contact." When they want to be alone, they completely cut off communication, making the other person anxious. Sometimes they disappear without even saying "I need to be alone, I'll contact you later."

7. Role in teams and organizations
Reflective-Stable types naturally take on roles as "deep analysts, quiet stabilizing elements, wise advisors." They don't have flashy leadership but are recognized as "That person's analysis has depth" and "Quiet but important person." Especially when complex problems arise, they provide insights that point to the essence: "In my opinion..."
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), conflicts arise from extreme speed differences. "Let's hurry" and "Let's think more" keep clashing. However, when Driving types push forward and Reflective-Stable points out "This looks risky," major mistakes can be prevented. Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find the Reflective-Stable's taciturnity and slow pace very frustrating. They rush saying "Say something" or "Hurry up," but Reflective-Stable becomes more withdrawn. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Expressive), deep conversations are possible, but since Reflective-Stable is the slowest, even other Reflective types sometimes get frustrated. With Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive), they collaborate comfortably with similar calmness and steadiness, creating stable and high-quality results, though slowly.
Collision points in organizations are "slow decision-making." "Let me think more" or "I'm not sure" - they postpone decisions indefinitely, causing frustration. Also, "passive participation" is problematic. They barely speak in meetings and don't actively step forward, receiving evaluations of "low participation."

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "very slow." They don't start until they completely understand and are sufficiently prepared, postponing the start saying "Not ready yet" or "Need to learn more..." Waiting for perfect understanding and certainty, they sometimes get chased by deadlines.
Persistence is "slow but steady." Once started, they work slowly at their own pace but don't stop. Without emotional ups and downs, the speed of work doesn't change with mood, and they steadily move forward bit by bit. Like a marathon runner, they endure well in the long run.
The finishing pattern is "careful and meticulous." They don't finish hastily but check until the end, continuously confirming "Is this enough?" However, with perfectionist tendencies, they keep revising saying "Still lacking," sometimes missing deadlines.
The problem is "starting and speed." They start too late and progress too slowly, making it difficult to adapt in fast environments.

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area that Reflective-Stable types need to consciously train is "quick decision-making and execution." Don't wait for "perfect understanding" but "start with 70% understanding" and "try first and adjust" - an experimental spirit is needed. Specific deadlines like "answer within 24 hours" or "start by this date no matter what" should be self-imposed.
The second is "emotional expression and communication." Don't cover up with "It's okay" or "It's nothing," but practice saying honestly "Actually, it's like this." Specific practices like "share your true feelings with a trusted person once a week" or "don't disappear without notice, say 'I need to be alone, I'll contact you later'" protect relationships.
The third is "starting small actions." Don't just think, practice "one action today," and adopt the mindset of "try it even if it's not perfect." Consciously maintaining the ratio of "30 minutes thinking, 2 hours action" is helpful.
In terms of environmental design, choose "a quiet and stable environment with appropriate stimulation." Avoid environments that are too fast and noisy, but also avoid completely isolated environments. Quiet environments like research, libraries, analytical work, and planning that still have minimal social connection are suitable.
As routine points, "maintaining social connections" is necessary. While being alone is comfortable, maintaining minimal relationships like "meeting close people once a month" or "contacting someone once a week" prevents isolation. Also, "action routines" are important. Small action routines like "30 minutes of exercise every morning" or "10 minutes of organizing every evening" should break the pattern of only thinking.

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A quiet sage and messenger of peace in the world who observes silently, thinks deeply, and accumulates wisdom calmly"
You are a person with rare quietness and depth in a noisy world. Without rushing, you grasp essence, maintain an unshakeable center, and convey tranquility to those around you just by your quiet presence. Your prudence prevents major mistakes, your depth discovers real problems, and your calmness puts a pause in a hurried world. If you decide a little faster, act even in small ways, and maintain connections with people, you will become not just a quiet observer but a truly influential sage who actually conveys wisdom and peace to the world.

name_en: Stable-Expressive Type
one_line: A warm haven and pillar of trust for the team who approaches warmly, empathizes calmly, and creates harmonious relationships
keywords: Gentleness, steadiness, affinity, calmness, consideration, reliability, comfort, harmony
strengths:
- Building long-term trust relationships lasting years through consistent attention and care
- Mediating conflicts between team members and providing emotional stability
cautions:
- Lack of decisiveness and passive attitude from inability to express own needs
- Habit of enduring and accumulating discomfort, then suddenly ending relationships at a critical point

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Stable-Expressive type has Stable as the primary temperament and Expressive as the secondary temperament. This creates a combination of "warm stability," producing energy that is calm and steady while communicating warmly with people and creating harmonious relationships.
The core of the energy starts with stability. Moving unhurriedly, steadily, predictably, they value consistency over change. They like routines, feel comfortable with the familiar, and avoid sudden changes. And on that stable foundation, they warmly interact with people. Not as flashy or intense as Expressive-Driving, but approaching gently, smiling kindly, and creating a comfortable atmosphere.
The difference from Expressive-Stable (Type 3) is important. Expressive-Stable has "sociability" first and "stability" regulates it, but Stable-Expressive has "stability" as the base and "sociability" softens it. The former essentially enjoys being with people but does so calmly, while the latter is essentially calm and quiet but approaches people kindly. If Expressive-Stable is "extroverted but calm" style, Stable-Expressive is "introverted but kind" style.
Energy is recharged through "comfortable relationships + stable routine." Spending time with close people without burden, resting quietly in familiar spaces, or maintaining a predictable daily life gradually recharges. Excessive social activities or constant change depletes energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Gentleness, steadiness, affinity, calmness, consideration, reliability, comfort, harmony
This temperament is summarized as "a presence like a gentle breeze." Action speed is slow to moderate, not rushing but maintaining their own pace. "It's okay to go slowly" - not impatient, and respecting others' pace too. Response style is gentle and receptive. They don't strongly refute or oppose but accept saying "That could be" or "You're right too."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. Little emotional fluctuation, attitude doesn't change with situations. Yesterday, today, and tomorrow look similar, so people can predict and feel reassured. They often hear "That person is always the same" or "Unchangingly kind." This consistency creates life stability and also conveys tranquility to those around them.
With Expressive elements as secondary, they are not completely quiet or isolated. They approach people first, smile brightly, and ask "How are you doing?" But not as active or deep as Expressive-Driving or Expressive-Reflective, they interact at a light and comfortable level.

3. Moments when strengths shine
Stable-Expressive types shine brightest "when creating and maintaining long-term relationships." Not one-time but relationships that continue for years or decades, they excel at consistently keeping in touch, taking care, and building trust. In fields like customer management, service, education, HR, and community management, they are recognized as "a person you can be with for a long time."
The second area where strengths appear is team harmony and atmosphere creation. When conflicts arise, they mediate saying "Couldn't we all compromise a little?" connect awkward people naturally, and create a harmonious environment saying "Let's all get along comfortably." Not flashy but responsible for the team's emotional stability.
The conditions for flow are clear. Collaborative atmosphere, human values, stable environment, and positive feedback are necessary. Where there's cooperation over competition, people over numbers, predictable routine over constant change, recognition over criticism, they demonstrate the best energy.
Also, autonomy is important. When trusted to "You handle it" without detailed interference, they work much more responsibly. Conversely, in cold, competitive, frequently changing, and critical environments, they withdraw and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Stable-Expressive types is "lacks own opinion" or "easy-going." Because they are kind, receptive, and often say "Yes" or "It's okay," they appear to have no opinion or be easily taken advantage of. But in reality, they have opinions but restrain expression to avoid conflict and maintain harmony.
The second misunderstanding is "slow" or "frustrating." They don't decide and execute quickly, requesting time saying "Let me think more." But in reality, they are just being careful, trying to avoid hasty mistakes.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, passive aggression. Unable to directly say "I don't like it," they outwardly pretend to accept saying "Oh, okay..." but actually don't act. Second, emotional suppression. Repeating "It's okay," they swallow discomfort inside, then suddenly explode or cut off the relationship when reaching their limit. Third, excessive sacrifice. Continuing to give up their own and endure, they burn out or become depressed. Fourth, relationship avoidance. When they feel "I can't take it anymore," they disappear without a word and cut off contact.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Stable-Expressive type's emotions are "calm and gentle wave type." No sudden ups and downs, maintaining relatively peaceful. Even when momentarily angry or sad, rather than expressing it strongly, they slowly digest it internally. The amplitude of emotion is small, so people around them think "They always seem okay," but actually they are quietly feeling.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "not being recognized or having conflict." When effort is taken for granted or ignored, they are hurt but can't express it and keep it inside. Also, when conflict or cold atmosphere continues, they become anxious, blaming themselves "What did I do wrong?"
Energy recovery occurs through "comfortable relationships + stable environment." Chatting comfortably with close people, spending time quietly in favorite spaces, or maintaining regular routines gradually recharges. Rather than dramatic stimulation or new experiences, familiar and safe things help with recovery.
Also, receiving "recognition and gratitude" gives great strength. When hearing words like "Thank you," "I'm glad you're here," or "Thanks for always taking care," they confirm their existence value and energy rises again.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Stable-Expressive types are "warm and reliable supporters." Not flashy or passionate expressions, but consistently staying by your side, helping when needed, and showing "I'm on your side" through actions. They listen well to the other person, empathize without judgment, and become "someone to lean on when it's hard."
In conflict situations, they have a style of "avoiding or trying to mediate." Very uncomfortable with direct confrontation, they try to ease tension saying "Let's not fight" or "Let's talk calmly." Even when not their fault, they say "I'm sorry" first to restore the relationship and try to understand the other's position.
The problem is "lack of clear expression." Not expressing their own desires, saying "Whatever you want" or "Anything is fine," the other person feels frustrated saying "I don't know what you really want." Also, "passivity" is a problem. Not expressing their opinion saying "Anything is fine," the relationship flows one-sidedly.
Another problem is "excessive consideration." They try to take care of even what makes the other person uncomfortable, or sacrifice themselves with the sense of responsibility "I have to do it for them," losing balance in the relationship.

7. Role in teams and organizations
Stable-Expressive types naturally take on roles as "team glue, atmosphere maker, relationship mediator." Not official leaders but recognized as "The team works properly because that person is there," evaluated as reliable team members who silently do their part.
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), they form complementary relationships. When Driving types push forward quickly, Stable-Expressive adjusts the pace saying "A little slower, so everyone can follow," and takes care of people's feelings that Driving types miss. Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find Stable-Expressive's taciturnity and slow pace very frustrating, but division of labor where Stable-Expressive handles execution and Expressive handles communication is effective. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), they encourage action saying "Don't think too deeply, just try it," and Reflective points out risk factors that Stable-Expressive missed. With Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Reflective), they collaborate most comfortably with similar calmness and steadiness, but Stable-Expressive is more sociable so mainly handles external communication.
Collision points in organizations are "lack of decisiveness." Giving frustration by not stating a clear position, saying "Well" or "Let me think about it." Also, "conflict avoidance" is problematic. Unable to give necessary feedback or pointing out, problems are not resolved and continue.

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "careful and slow." They wait until they understand enough and are prepared, postponing the start saying "Let me look into it more" or "When I'm certain." Not jumping in hastily, they try to minimize risk with Stable prudence.
Persistence is "steady but needs feedback." Once started, there's responsibility to go all the way, maintaining routines well and not easily giving up. But if doing alone for too long or without feedback, they become anxious wondering "Am I doing this right?" and motivation drops. Regular encouragement or words like "You're doing well" become fuel to maintain persistence.
The finishing pattern is "conscientiously complete." Even if not flashy, they meet requirements and finish without mistakes. However, not perfectionists, they can finish at an appropriate point knowing "This is enough."
The problem is "speed." Too slow and frustrating for other temperaments, especially Driving types. When receiving pressure to "Hurry up," they rather become more withdrawn and slower.

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Stable-Expressive types need to consciously train is "clear expression and healthy rejection." Clearly say "Yes/No," express "I think this way," and practice rejecting "Sorry but this is difficult." Concrete goals like "clearly state my opinion once a day" or "reject once a week" are helpful.
The second is "conflict confrontation ability." Don't endure discomfort but express early "Actually I..." or "This part is uncomfortable." Understanding that avoiding conflict is not peace, but rather makes problems grow.
The third is "self-care and boundary setting." Value yourself as much as you care for others, and clearly set "time for me" and "my limits." The principle of "not saying YES to every request" is necessary.
In terms of environmental design, choose "collaborative and humane culture." Rather than cold and competitive environments, organizations that value teamwork and respect people are suitable. Also, stable structure is important. Environments with too much change or high uncertainty cause stress.
As routine points, "regular feedback" is important. Rather than working alone anxiously about "Am I doing well?" periodically asking "Am I doing well?" is helpful. Also, "checking my emotions" time should be had daily. Asking yourself "What was uncomfortable today?" and "What was good?" and consciously checking to not suppress emotions.

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A warm haven and pillar of trust for the team who approaches warmly, empathizes calmly, and creates harmonious relationships"
You are a precious person who creates peace and connection among people. You make people around you comfortable with kindness and stability, build long-term relationships with consistent attention, and are an invisible pillar quietly supporting the team. Your gentleness makes people feel safe, your consistency builds trust, and your consideration makes organizations more humane. If you value yourself a little more, express honestly, and set healthy boundaries, you will become not just a nice person but a true master of relationships who loves themselves and also healthily supports others with mature grace.

name_en: Stable-Driving Type
one_line: A reliable pillar and architect of efficiency in the organization who judges calmly, executes steadily, and creates results stably
keywords: Reliability, steadiness, efficiency, composure, responsibility, stability, execution power, balance
strengths:
- Excellence in fields requiring flawless results such as operations management and quality control
- System-building capability to systematize chaotic situations and operate efficiently
cautions:
- Conservative response to change or new attempts by insisting only on verified methods
- Tendency to ignore others' emotional aspects while focusing only on efficiency

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Stable-Driving type has Stable as the primary temperament and Driving as the secondary temperament. This creates a combination of "calm executor," producing energy that is fundamentally stable and prudent but pushes firmly toward goals when necessary.
The core of the energy starts with stability. Moving unhurriedly, steadily, predictably, they value consistency over change. Not swayed by emotions, they maintain calmness and judge carefully. And on that stable foundation, they set clear goals and execute efficiently. "Go slowly but surely reach the goal" - slow but don't stop and eventually create results.
The difference from Driving-Stable (Type 6) is important. Driving-Stable has "goals" first and "stability" regulates the execution method, but Stable-Driving has "stability" as the base and "driving force" is demonstrated when needed. The former is essentially goal-oriented but goes carefully, while the latter essentially seeks stability but produces results when necessary. If Driving-Stable is "not fast but steadily pushes forward" style, Stable-Driving is "calm but definitely gets it done when needed" style.
Energy is recharged through "stable achievement and predictable environment." When proceeding as planned, small achievements steadily accumulate, and work flows without major fluctuations, they feel fulfilled. Conversely, sudden changes, constant crises, and unpredictable situations continuing deplete energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Reliability, steadiness, efficiency, composure, responsibility, stability, execution power, balance
This temperament is summarized as "reliable stable executor." Action speed is moderate, neither immediate nor very slow. They move after judging enough, but once started, push steadily. Response style is calm and composed. Not reacting hastily but maintaining equanimity "Let's calm down first and go step by step."
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. Almost no emotional fluctuation, attitude doesn't change much with situations. Maintaining similar appearance in good or bad times, they often hear "That person is unchanging" or "Predictable." This consistency gives great trust to those around them.
With Driving elements as secondary, they are not completely passive or indecisive. When goals are clear, they definitely do "what needs to be done," make necessary decisions, and fulfill responsibilities. They receive evaluations like "Doesn't talk much but work is solid" or "Can trust and delegate."

3. Moments when strengths shine
Stable-Driving types shine brightest "when stably creating results." Rather than explosively producing results in a hurry, they excel at steadily moving toward goals without mistakes. In fields like operations management, project management, quality control, and administrative work, they earn trust saying "I can relax when that person is in charge."
The second area where strengths appear is crisis management and stabilization. Even in panic situations, they maintain composure and center the team saying "Let's calm down first and solve it in order." Also, they systematize chaotic organizations, operate efficiently, and make things "now running stably."
The conditions for flow are clear. Clear goals and structure, autonomy and responsibility, stable environment, and long-term perspective are necessary. Clear target of "achieve this" and systematic process, trust saying "You handle it, but be responsible for results," predictable environment with few sudden changes, long-term view rather than short-term performance pressure produce the best results.
Conversely, in constantly changing environments, impromptu work, micromanaging, and routine without goals, they become frustrated and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Stable-Driving types is "boring" or "conservative." Because they value stability, approach change cautiously, and prefer verified methods. They show reactions like "It's working well now, why change?" and get misunderstood as "blocking innovation." But in reality, they are concerned about the risks of reckless change and prefer methods that improve stably.
The second misunderstanding is "inflexible." Because they stick to methods once decided, emphasize efficiency, and insist "This is the right way." But in reality, they are just following the verified best method, and can change if a better method is proven.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, excessive control. "Only my way" - not accepting any other methods and insisting only on their own system. Second, passive aggression. Outwardly saying "Yes, understood" but actually only doing their own way or not doing it at all. Third, cynicism and criticism. "I knew it wouldn't work" or "It's inefficient" - coldly pointing out and making the atmosphere cold. Fourth, complete withdrawal. "I don't care" - letting go of everything and being a bystander.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Stable-Driving type's emotions are "calm and stable flatland type." No sudden ups and downs, maintaining relatively peaceful. Even with happy events, they don't get too excited, and even with difficult events, they don't easily collapse. Not strongly expressing emotions externally, they process them logically internally.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "inefficiency and disorder." When forced to follow clearly inefficient processes, when chaotic and unstructured environment continues, or when their efficient suggestions are ignored, frustration and dissatisfaction accumulate inside. "It would be better this way" or "Why don't they understand" - they feel frustrated.
Energy recovery occurs through "stable routine and small achievements." Maintaining predictable daily life, consistent exercise, and regular sleep gradually recharges. Also, checking off "today's tasks completed" or "this week's goal achieved" and confirming "I'm going right" restores energy.
Also, "recovering sense of control" is important. When regaining the feeling that they can understand and manage the situation, they feel stable. Conversely, unpredictable and uncontrollable chaos continuing rapidly depletes them.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Stable-Driving types are "reliable but restrained in expression." No flashy emotional expressions, but they steadily fulfill responsibilities, keep promises, and give practical help saying "I'll take care of it." They express interest through actions rather than words, solving problems saying "I solved this" or "Don't worry."
In conflict situations, they have a style of "trying to solve with logic." Not responding emotionally but organizing systematically "The fact is this, the problem is this, the solution is this." However, when the other person pours out emotions, they transition to finding solutions asking "So what do you want to do?" not understanding the request to "just listen."
The problem is "ignoring emotions." Focusing only on efficiency and logic, they dismiss the other person's emotions as "inefficient." They frustrate the other person with words like "Why is that a problem?" or "Think logically."
Another problem is "resistance to change." Even in relationships, they block new attempts saying "It's fine now, why change?" and try to repeat only safe and familiar patterns.

7. Role in teams and organizations
Stable-Driving types naturally take on roles as "organization's stabilizing force, operations manager, reliable executor." Not flashy leadership, but recognized as key personnel saying "Work runs properly because that person is there." Especially when complex problems arise, they provide insights pointing to essence saying "In my opinion..."
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Reflective), there's similarity in goal orientation, but Stable-Driving is slower and more cautious, causing friction from speed differences. However, when Driving's speed and Stable-Driving's stability combine, it becomes the best combination of "fast yet mistake-free." Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find Stable-Driving's taciturnity and logic-centeredness frustrating, but division where Stable-Driving handles execution and Expressive handles communication is effective. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), prudence is similar, but Stable-Driving is more execution-centered, so they can rush asking "How long are you just going to think?" With Stable temperaments (Stable-Reflective, Stable-Expressive), they collaborate most comfortably with similar calmness and steadiness, and Stable-Driving adds driving force to create actual results.
Collision points in organizations are "resistance to change." They passively block even necessary innovation saying "It's working well now, do we really need to change?" Also, "lack of flexibility" is problematic. They give frustration saying "This is the established way" or "It's not allowed by regulations," not recognizing exceptions.

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "careful but execution-oriented." They start after understanding enough and making plans, but don't postpone indefinitely like Reflective types. When feeling "Prepared enough," they move to execution, and move faster when goals are clear.
Persistence is "very strong." Once started, they don't give up midway and push through to the end. Not swayed by emotional ups and downs or interest, if it's "work that needs to be done," they do it steadily. Maintaining routines well, they endure long hauls well.
The finishing pattern is "stable and solid." Even if not flashy, they meet requirements and finish without mistakes. Using checklists to check for missed parts, when meeting the standard "This is enough," they finish cleanly.
The problem is "excessive prudence." Sometimes when quick decisions and execution are needed, they miss opportunities saying "Need to check more..."

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Stable-Driving types need to consciously train is "flexibility and accepting change." Shift from "It's fine now" to "It can get better" perspective, and experimental spirit to try from small changes is needed. Imposing specific deadlines on themselves like "try 1 new method this month" or "It's okay to fail, we're learning" mindset is important.
The second is "emotional awareness and empathy." Don't look only at efficiency but consciously practice reading and considering emotions "How might that person feel now?" Just changing the order to "empathize before criticizing" and "acknowledge emotions before offering solutions" improves relationships.
The third is "quick decision practice." Don't wait until collecting all information, but training to speed up like "decide with 80% information" or "answer within 24 hours" is needed.
In terms of environmental design, choose "environment with stable structure and clear goals." Rather than constantly changing or crisis-prone environments, predictable and systematic organizations are suitable. Also, culture of "being evaluated by results" is important. Motivated in environments that recognize by performance rather than process.
As routine points, "trying small challenges" is necessary. Don't stay only in the safe zone, but trying one "new attempt" once a week helps growth. Also, "emotional expression" routine is important. Checking "3 emotions felt today" and occasionally sharing "Actually..." true feelings with trusted people deepens relationships.

10. Describing this temperament in one sentence
"A reliable pillar and architect of efficiency in the organization who judges calmly, executes steadily, and creates results stably"
You are a person who is not hasty but surely reaches goals. Equipped with both stability and execution power, you create results steadily without mistakes, systematize chaotic situations, and operate efficiently. Your consistency gives people trust, your responsibility stabilizes organizations, and your composure centers in crisis situations. If you accept change a little more flexibly, acknowledge emotions, and have courage to decide quickly, you will become not just a stable manager but a truly balanced leader who achieves both innovation and stability.

name_en: Stable-Reflective Type
one_line: A quiet sage who lives calmly, reflects deeply, and creates a meaningful life at their own pace
keywords: Prudence, steadiness, inner depth, calmness, consistency, thoughtfulness, serenity, self-awareness
strengths:
- Long-term growth achieved at own pace without being swayed by external trends
- Sincerity that builds life's meaning one by one with realistic and calm attitude
cautions:
- Misunderstanding from others as lacking ambition or being too passive
- Stagnation phenomenon of fearing new changes and trying to stay only in safe zone

1. What is this temperament's energy structure?
The Stable-Reflective type has Stable as the primary temperament and Reflective as the secondary temperament. This creates a combination of "prudent stability seeker," producing energy that fundamentally pursues stability calmly and steadily, while thinking deeply and finding meaning in the process.
The core of the energy starts with stability. Living unhurriedly, steadily, predictably, they value consistency over change. They like routines, feel comfortable with the familiar, and avoid sudden changes. And within that stable life, they deeply reflect "Why do I live like this?" or "Is this what I really want?" They don't just live habitually but consciously look back on their life and choices.
The difference from Reflective-Stable (Type 9) is important. Reflective-Stable has "understanding and meaning" first and "stability" is the exploration method, but Stable-Reflective has "stable life" first and "reflection" is a tool to make that life more meaningful. The former is essentially an explorer but does it calmly, while the latter essentially wants stability but thinks about it. If Reflective-Stable constantly asks "Why?" then Stable-Reflective occasionally asks "Is this stability really good?"
Energy is recharged through "peaceful routine + quiet reflection." Predictable daily life, familiar spaces, and time alone for thinking are necessary. Conversely, constant change, noisy environment, and busyness without time to think deeply deplete energy.

2. Core characteristics at a glance
Core keywords: Prudence, steadiness, inner depth, calmness, consistency, thoughtfulness, serenity, self-awareness
This temperament is summarized as "a thoughtful person who quietly goes their own way." Action speed is slow. They wait until they think enough and are certain enough, maintaining their own pace saying "No need to rush, let's go slowly." Response style is prudent and restrained. Not reacting immediately but answering carefully after thinking "Hmm..." for a moment.
In terms of stability, they are very consistent. Almost no emotional fluctuation, attitude doesn't change with situations, and they maintain similar appearance over a long time. They often hear "That person is always calm" or "Unchanging." This consistency creates life stability and also conveys tranquility to those around them.
With Reflective elements as secondary, they don't just live habitually but sometimes think deeply. "Am I living properly now?" or "Is this the life I really want?" - they look back on themselves and try to avoid meaningless repetition. However, unlike Reflective-Driving or Reflective-Expressive, they don't express it externally or turn it into action, but quietly organize it internally.

3. Moments when strengths shine
Stable-Reflective types shine brightest "when doing work that requires both steadiness and depth." Rather than explosively producing results in a hurry, they excel at completing long-term projects calmly while not missing meaning, thinking "Why do it this way?" about essence. In fields like research, analysis, planning, documentation, and quality control, they produce "deep and steady" results.
The second area where strengths appear is self-awareness and growth. They know their strengths and weaknesses accurately, realistically grasping "I'm good at this, this is difficult." Not trying to change hastily, but improving slowly and steadily, they achieve long-term growth saying "I'm better than last year's me."
The conditions for flow are clear. Sufficient time, stable environment, meaningful work, and autonomy are necessary. Leisure that respects their own pace without hasty rushing, predictable structure with few sudden changes, tasks that allow thinking "why" rather than simple repetition, and trust saying "You handle it" produce the best results.
Conversely, in constant rushing, chaotic environment, meaningless repetition, and excessive interference, they become frustrated and lose energy.

4. Common misunderstandings and shadows
The most common misunderstanding about Stable-Reflective types is "passive" or "lacks ambition." Because they don't grow fast or pursue big goals, saying "It's fine now" or "Let's go slowly." But in reality, they are growing at their own pace and just evaluate life by internal standards rather than external ones.
The second misunderstanding is "indecisive" or "can't make decisions." Because they wait until thinking enough and being certain, requesting time saying "Let me think more." But in reality, they are just being careful and don't want to harm stability with hasty decisions.
Shadows that appear in stressful situations manifest in several forms. First, excessive reflection. "What did I do wrong?" or "Why is this happening?" - thinking all day without any action. Second, complete withdrawal. "I don't care" - retreating from everything and isolating. Third, change resistance. "It's fine now" - blocking even necessary change and staying only in safe zone. Fourth, depression and lethargy. "Nothing matters anyway" - doing nothing and living lethargically.

5. Emotional flow and recovery patterns
Stable-Reflective type's emotions are "calm but occasionally deepening lake type." Most of the time maintained peacefully, but when reflecting deeply occasionally, emotions become complex. When asking questions like "Am I really happy?" or "Is this life meaningful?" they feel anxiety or emptiness. But they don't express it strongly externally, digesting it quietly internally.
The way emotions accumulate stems from "loss of meaning and forced change." When life feels like only simple repetition, forced to change suddenly, or not having their pace respected, anxiety and fatigue accumulate inside. "What's the meaning of all this" or "I wish they'd just leave me alone" - they desperately want but can't say and endure.
Energy recovery occurs through "alone peaceful time." Reading books quietly in a quiet space, organizing thoughts while walking, or looking inward while writing in a diary recharges them. Interaction with people is not essential, and they actually need to be alone to recover.
Also, "familiar routine" helps with recovery. A predictable daily life of waking up at the same time every morning, drinking coffee at the same cafe, and walking the same path provides stability and conserves energy.

6. Temperament reactions in relationships
In intimate relationships, Stable-Reflective types are "quietly together." No flashy expressions or passionate displays of affection, but they consistently stay by your side and support with their presence saying "I'm here." They try to understand the other person deeply, accept without judgment, and give space saying "That could be."
In conflict situations, they have a strong tendency to "avoid or internalize." Very uncomfortable with direct confrontation, they try to cover up problems saying "It's okay" or "It's nothing." They avoid uncomfortable conversations and analyze alone thinking "Why did this happen?" But if problems continue, they accumulate inside and at some point "I can't take it anymore" - they quietly end the relationship.
The problem is "lack of expression." Rarely revealing true feelings and repeating "I'm okay," the other person feels frustrated saying "I don't know what you're thinking." Also, "passivity" is a problem. Not expressing their opinion saying "Anything is fine," the relationship flows one-sidedly.
Another problem is "resistance to change." Even in relationships, they block new attempts saying "It's fine now, why change?" and try to maintain only familiar patterns.

7. Role in teams and organizations
Stable-Reflective types naturally take on roles as "quiet observer, deep analyst, stable contributor." Not flashy leadership, but recognized as "That person's opinion has depth" and evaluated as reliable team members who silently do their part.
Looking at synergy with other temperaments, with Driving temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Driving-Expressive, Driving-Stable, Driving-Reflective), conflicts arise from extreme speed differences. "Let's hurry" and "Let's think more" keep clashing. Expressive temperaments (Expressive-Driving, Expressive-Reflective, Expressive-Stable) find Stable-Reflective's taciturnity and slow pace very frustrating. With Reflective temperaments (Reflective-Driving, Reflective-Stable, Reflective-Expressive), deep conversations are possible, but Stable-Reflective is most passive about execution, so even other Reflective types sometimes ask "So when will you do it?" With Stable temperaments (Stable-Driving, Stable-Expressive), they collaborate most comfortably with similar calmness and steadiness, creating quiet but high-quality results.
Collision points in organizations are "slow pace." Everything is slow, making it difficult to adapt in urgent environments. Also, "passive participation" is problematic. Barely speaking in meetings and not actively stepping forward, sometimes receiving evaluations of "no presence."

8. Work style and execution rhythm
Starting speed is "very slow." They don't start until completely understanding, thinking enough, and being certain. Continuing to postpone the start saying "Not ready yet" or "Need to think more..." they sometimes get chased by deadlines waiting for perfect certainty.
Persistence is "slow but steady." Once started, they work slowly at their own pace but don't stop. Maintaining consistent speed without emotional ups and downs, they endure long hauls well. Like a marathon runner, even if it takes long, they eventually arrive.
The finishing pattern is "careful and meticulous." Not finishing hastily but checking until the end, continuously confirming "Is this enough?" They finish while looking back on whether meaning is properly contained and essence is not missed. However, with perfectionist tendencies, they keep revising saying "Still lacking," sometimes missing deadlines.
The problem is "starting and speed." Starting too late and progressing too slowly, it's difficult to survive in fast environments.

9. Growth direction and temperament management strategies
The first area Stable-Reflective types need to consciously train is "quick decision and execution." Don't wait for "perfect understanding" but "start with 70% understanding" and "try first and adjust" - experimental spirit is needed. Imposing specific deadlines on themselves like "answer within 24 hours" or "start by this date no matter what" is necessary.
The second is "stopping excessive reflection." Don't try to understand everything perfectly, but develop the ability to decide "This is enough" or "Stop this thought now." Consciously maintaining the ratio of "30 minutes thinking, 1 hour action" is helpful.
The third is "trying small changes." Don't stay only in safe zone, but try "1 new thing this month" - small challenges are necessary for growth. The mindset of "It's okay to fail, can go back to original" is important.
In terms of environmental design, choose "quiet and stable but meaningful environment." Avoid environments that are too fast and chaotic, but also avoid completely meaningless repetitive work. Fields like research, analysis, planning, and quality control that are quiet but require depth are suitable.
As routine points, "action routines" are necessary. Small action routines like "30 minutes of exercise every morning" or "10 minutes of organizing every evening" should break the pattern of only thinking. Also, "maintaining social connections" is important. To not become completely isolated, maintaining minimal relationships like "meeting close people once a month" is necessary.
